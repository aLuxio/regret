Let's be completely real here, Needville HS Comp Sci is in trouble. This is why we, the big bois you know and love, are compiling a collection of resources concerning you future contestants of the computer science clan. Know these programs and algorithms and study them well. Let them consume you in their arithmetic sequences, go on a journey for your spirit animal through the regular expressions, let the juicy runtimes stimulate your chakra and give you positive chi energy. We don't vibe with any of that negative garbo, like recursive maze solvers.
