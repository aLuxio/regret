Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?
Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.
Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit. 
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.
Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?

You don't believe in the Force, do you? As you wish. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! As you wish.

Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on
with that one and just dispelled that one.  You know, they lay down with
their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at their
loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well,
no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show ..
You know? But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is
'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the
reason you must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone
that is not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family,
and they will come at you in all forms and shapes. Yes! I don't read
anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my precious time on
such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that there
was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. But ... whatever. I
agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a
wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is they
want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that
opens on a tugboat. And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow
warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon
complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total
surrender. In fact, a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing',
as they should. And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically
disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to
the amateurs and the bible grippers.  .. And then, I just got to add
this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a
part of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say
about it: Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke,
and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So ..
But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all
have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. Because you have
absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence
and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be questioned.  Yeah,
I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm
dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on
the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and
the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay
... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't
know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold.
Because you have absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you
love with violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be
questioned. He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not
just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part
of me, which is 'courage'. Take for instance its founder and death written
... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until
the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of
lies. You know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in
my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have time for
these clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their stupidity and
.. (sighs)  No, you won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good,
guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. Yeah, why not?
'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms.  Take for instance
its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist
... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that
chapter in his silly book of lies. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't
know. Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know? Yeah,
but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people',
and I have cleansed myself. Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read
it. I don't care. But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my
motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do so
violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because ... and you
have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because they're there to
destroy your family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes. You
know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my
underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these
clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their stupidity and ..
(sighs)  I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly
privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I
sure like the view, Alex. The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me
just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough
... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial
descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right? And we are
and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with
winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. Let me just say this:
It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah,
that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit
strategy, bro. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his
job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat
them, but embarrass them in the process. I am every character in between,
save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water.
That's not me.   And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and
dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you ..
Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! Debate
me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain;
with my mind.  Take for instance its founder and death written ... I don't
know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he
died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies. Let me
just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim
Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his
own selfish exit strategy, bro.   Because you have absolute and total
resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with
violence, there's nothing that can be questioned. And I was getting a
tattoo during the death from above. And it's the banner from the death card
that Kilgore is throwing on his victims. How complicated can it be? What
they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other
gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican
assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. Yeah, I
didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that
one and just dispelled that one. I am every character in between, save for
that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not
me. How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you
and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we
are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people.
See where that goes. And that was actually, you know, one of the few
compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade.  Because
I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave
a warning, you know?  Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of
deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name -
mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro. So if you
think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an
excuse. They have zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them
as the last image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out
there and they will sell me, and they will lose.  And that was actually,
you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin'
almost a decade. You know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just
strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't
have time for these clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their
stupidity and .. (sighs) So ... you know ... within that is tremendous
focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. They have zero. They
have that night, and I will forget about them as the last image of them
exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will sell me,
and they will lose. Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of
deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name -
mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro.  I'm done.
I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'.  And if you're a
part of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to
hurt my family, I will murder you violently. And Alex, try to get your mind
around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire
manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of
complete and total surrender. It's being directed and written by a genius
name David Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for
writing The Sting. And it was his pen and his vision that created the
classic that we know today as Major League. Yes! I don't read anything
after it's come out, because I will not waste my precious time on such
ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that there was a
lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. And Alex, try to get your
mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire
manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of
complete and total surrender. So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm
0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. I'm done. I'm done. It's on.
Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't
know. Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know? No, you
won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking.
Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. It's ... yeah ... it's an
understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got
poetry in my fingertips.  He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If
... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill
another part of me, which is 'courage'. I am every character in between,
save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water.
That's not me. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just
... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. 100%.
You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. I'm
done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. You know?
Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear
before my first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I
don't have time for their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs)
But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.
Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those
people', and I have cleansed myself. But it's just not ... I'm not fair
game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. How complicated can it be? What
they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other
gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican
assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes.  Well,
yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you
can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh
.. But I dare anyone to debate me on things. No, you won't get high ..
It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No
panic, no judgment.   And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not
to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above
the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. Take for instance its
founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ...
stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that
chapter in his silly book of lies. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He
was a pussy! No. She's not there now. In fact, a lot of people think the
movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's
just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. Yeah. I did. Because he's
nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass
people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the
process.   And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the
middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get
embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option. I just
closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous
model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the
work of sissies. But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal
point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company
- need to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they
don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. So ... you know ... within that
is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace.  Yeah, I
didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that
one and just dispelled that one. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! There's a new sheriff
in town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican
assassins. I am every character in between, save for that little weirdo
with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. .. And then,
I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke
being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is
all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are now three.
Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ...
badly... So .. 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the
right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's
life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal
and it's pure and it's available to everybody. Well, I'm not Thomas
Jefferson .. He was a pussy! I am every character in between, save for
that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not
me.  You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am
battle-tested bayonets, bro. No, you won't get high .. It's all good.
It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment.

Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my
brain; with my mind. And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be
special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of
you! ... There it is. And that was actually, you know, one of the few
compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. And Alex,
try to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the

can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh
.. They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners. In 22
years the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren were
either driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an abandoned
bridge. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your
resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my
attack. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I
am battle-tested bayonets, bro. And Alex, try to get your mind around this,
as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built
upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total

flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... I'm done. I'm done. It's

the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of
the heart ... of the hearts. And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I
don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's
where you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an
option. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to
go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but
embarrass them in the process. Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read
it. I don't care. The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say
this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is
good enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions,
you must use the best choice available, right?  I am every character in
between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for
water. That's not me. Take for instance its founder and death written ... I
don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day
he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies. Let
me just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain
Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for
his own selfish exit strategy, bro. And I'm ... you know ... most of the
time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will
destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And,
uh .. And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior,
deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and
total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total surrender. Major
League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care.   Well, I think it
was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right.
And I'm not ... Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and
not to completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if
I bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no
reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and
they have nothing.  Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I
went straight on with that one and just dispelled that one. I'm done. I'm
done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. It's ... yeah ... it's
an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I
got poetry in my fingertips.    And I was getting a tattoo during the death
from above. And it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is
throwing on his victims. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie.
Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the
hearts. 100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your
mouth.    And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your
resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my
attack. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from
'those people', and I have cleansed myself.  You know, he might be Nails,
but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. No.
She's not there now. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top
Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the
chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted
to and those people were in their way. Because ... look at what I'm dealing
with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls.    Well, yeah. But I was
gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about
that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. 'You have the
right to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's
the whole movie. That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that.
There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available
to everybody. There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of
assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. Take for instance
its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist
... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that
chapter in his silly book of lies.  Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure
... pure and complete gnarlyisms.  Um ... but I'm excited to get back ...
to work. Um ... and not to completely discount what you just talked about
... It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little
losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold, because
I have real fame, and they have nothing. And the gratitude I get is this
charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who
believes he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it.   I
just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous
model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the
work of sissies.   It's being directed and written by a genius name David
Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The
Sting. And it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we
know today as Major League. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You
know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my
fingertips.  In fact, a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild
Thing', as they should. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of
pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every
second .. And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods
at every frickin' turn.  It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You
know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my
fingertips. I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly
privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I
sure like the view, Alex. But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just
one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great
company - need to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash.
If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. Let me just say this:
It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah,
that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit
strategy, bro.  I am every character in between, save for that little
weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. The
only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg
cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now
supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! No, you
won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking.
Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. He's as radical as you'd think he'd
might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the
river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. Yeah. I did. Because
he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass
people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the
process.   But I dare anyone to debate me on things. Let me just say this:
It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah,

It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. 'You have the right to kill
me, but you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole
movie. That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's
focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to
everybody.   You know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing
runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have
time for these clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their
stupidity and .. (sighs)  But there are parts of me that is hopper,
because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do
so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because ... and
you have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because they're there
to destroy your family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes.
Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause
he got it right. And I'm not ... Debate me on AA right now. I have a
disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind.  Because I'm
just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave a
warning, you know? And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work
through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're
gonna fuel my attack. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and
complete gnarlyisms. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work

I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You know,
I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my
ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. And therefore there's nothing in the
middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you get
slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen.
And it's just not an option. You know, they lay down with their ugly wives
in front of their ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then
they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never
will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know?  But
like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all
have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. 100%. You know, here's
your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. I just closed my eyes and

say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine
- yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own

just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough
... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial
descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right? But it's just
not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.  Um ... but
I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely discount
what you just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these ... these
turds ... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back
into the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing. But there's
also ... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my
life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye.  In
fact, a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they
should. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like,
'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t.
... uh .. And I was getting a tattoo during the death from above. And
it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his
victims. I am every character in between, save for that little weirdo with

this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine -
yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish
exit strategy, bro.  So ... you know ... within that is tremendous focus,
and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. I just closed my eyes and in
a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease,
addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. But
there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either
love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you
must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is
not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family, and they
will come at you in all forms and shapes.  They will lose the rest of their
lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives. So
... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me
a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING!  
You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly
children and just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and
say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just
sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? 100%. You know, here's your
first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. No. She's not there now. I'm
cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and
frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun. You know,
they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and
just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T

... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because
they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in all
forms and shapes. And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing.
Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins. And
people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your resentments.'
Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack.  But
there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree.

hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack.  And one of those stupid
mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am
special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. And you know, I'm
tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect and
bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect and
bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. But it's
just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. And that
was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me
in frickin' almost a decade. No. She's not there now. But I dare anyone to
debate me on things. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie.
Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the
hearts.   But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So
what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts.  Yeah, but I
can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I
have cleansed myself. They have zero. They have that night, and I will
forget about them as the last image of them exits my beautiful home. And
they will get out there and they will sell me, and they will lose.  Major
League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. Because I'm just
... um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave a
warning, you know? But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft

..  Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to
completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I
bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no
reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and
they have nothing. Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because
I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I
understand, according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the
Vatican assassins. So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3
with marriage, with ne'er an excuse.  100%. You know, here's your first pee
test. Next one goes in your mouth.  But ... whatever. I agreed to do it.
There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan
Creek, a great company - need to work out is they want me in it. If they
do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. 
There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must
speak of the Vatican assassins. Because you have absolute and total resolve
about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence,
there's nothing that can be questioned. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell
you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You
can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. They urge you to put down
your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I
could locate in their toothless warren were either driving a convertible
van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge. They urge you to put
down your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I
could locate in their toothless warren were either driving a convertible
van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge.  Debate me on AA right
now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind.
But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You
either love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason
you must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that
is not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family, and
they will come at you in all forms and shapes.  And if you're a part of my
family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my
family, I will murder you violently. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy
of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass
them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the process. But it's just
not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. 100%. You

shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible
grippers. I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly

Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us.   And one of those stupid mottoes,
Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and
I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. Because ... look at what I'm
dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. I just closed my eyes

naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I
will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. And then, I
just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke
being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is
all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are now three.
Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ...
badly... So .. But there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple from

It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers
... there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have
real fame, and they have nothing. I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin'
hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up
here, but I sure like the view, Alex. And I'm ... you know ... most of the
time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will
destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And,
uh .. And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long
silence) .. Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be
us. And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of
us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it
is. But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that
Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to
work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't,
it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. And I'm like ... guys, it's right
there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're
Vatican assassins. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never
has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts.
Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out
there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but
embarrass them in the process. They have zero. They have that night, and I
will forget about them as the last image of them exits my beautiful home.
And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they will lose. They
will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for
the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a
challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ...
it just ain't there. WINNING! The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let
me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good
enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial
descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right?  'You have the
right to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's
the whole movie. That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that.
There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available
to everybody.  And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes
naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I
will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. I'm gonna hang out
with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You
know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. Yeah, why
not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. Yeah. I did.
Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and
embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in
the process. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my
life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm
not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin'
turn.  But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point
that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need
to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't,
it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. They have zero. They have that night,
and I will forget about them as the last image of them exits my beautiful
home. And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they will
lose. But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that
Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to
work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't,
it's a turd that opens on a tugboat.  But it's just not ... I'm not fair
game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.  Um ... but I'm excited to get back
... to work. Um ... and not to completely discount what you just talked
about ... It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these
little losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold,
because I have real fame, and they have nothing. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's
just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. Yeah. I did. Because he's
nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass
people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the
process. Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to
completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I
bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no
reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and
they have nothing. So ... you know ... within that is tremendous focus, and
tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. Um ... but I'm excited to get
back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely discount what you just
talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ...
these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back into the
fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing. And therefore
there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's
where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed in front of the
prom queen. And it's just not an option. They urge you to put down your
sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could
locate in their toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or
living like trolls under an abandoned bridge.   And you know, I'm tired ...
I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just
winning every second .. And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just
delivering the goods at every frickin' turn.  Yes! I don't read anything
after it's come out, because I will not waste my precious time on such
ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that there was a
lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. It's being directed and
written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the
Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was his pen and his
vision that created the classic that we know today as Major League. And
that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid
me in frickin' almost a decade. How complicated can it be? What they're not
ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly
gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin
warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. They have zero.
They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last image of
them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will
sell me, and they will lose. In fact, a lot of people think the movie's
called 'Wild Thing', as they should. And I was getting a tattoo during the
death from above. And it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is
throwing on his victims. Because you have absolute and total resolve about
your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence,
there's nothing that can be questioned. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so
tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just
winning every second .. And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just
delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. But I dare anyone to debate me
on things. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front
of his children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind
can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last
decade, I don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans
into pure gold. But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto
now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And
the reason you must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate
everyone that is not in your family, because they're there to destroy your
family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes. Yeah. I did.
Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and
embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in
the process. I am every character in between, save for that little weirdo
with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me.  Yeah, I sat
with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping
pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the
beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way.   Because you have absolute and total resolve about your
decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence, there's
nothing that can be questioned. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement.
You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my
fingertips. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete
gnarlyisms.   So ... you know ... within that is tremendous focus, and
tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just
pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. But there are parts of me that is
hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you
must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because
... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because
they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in all
forms and shapes. Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because I
will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I
understand, according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the
Vatican assassins. And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to
do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above
the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. Well, I'm not Thomas
Jefferson .. He was a pussy! But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's
just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a
great company - need to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a
smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. And if you're a
part of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to
hurt my family, I will murder you violently. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! The only
thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult -
you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a
5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! They will lose the
rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of
their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge,
somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just
ain't there. WINNING! And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this
includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the
air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. So if you
think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an
excuse. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this
ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's
just the work of sissies.  You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in
front of their ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then
they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never
will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? It's ...
yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got
magic and I got poetry in my fingertips.  Yes! I don't read anything after
it's come out, because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous
nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of
curiosity about the Vatican assassins.  And I'm like ... guys, it's right
there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're
Vatican assassins.     Take for instance its founder and death written ...
I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the
day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies.
Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. Let me just
say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine
- yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own
selfish exit strategy, bro.  You know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's
just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I
don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and
their stupidity and .. (sighs)
And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't
perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect
and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. I am
every character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts
strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. He's as radical as you'd
think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ...
petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. Well,
I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy!   But there's also ...
falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life.
Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. In fact,
a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. And
people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your resentments.'
Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. But
it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. So
if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with
ne'er an excuse.   THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! There's a new sheriff in town, and
he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins.
They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years
the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren were either
driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge.

don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day
he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies. I'm
cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and
frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun. Yeah, but I
can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I
have cleansed myself. And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone?
.. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that
would be us. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and
touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot
of fun. But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point

it's a turd that opens on a tugboat.  But I dare anyone to debate me on
things. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So
what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. It's ...
yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got
magic and I got poetry in my fingertips.  No, you won't get high .. It's
all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no
judgment. How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys
like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ...
that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that,
people. See where that goes. Well, I think it was Nails that said I was
really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... And
therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle
anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed
in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option. 100%. You know,

disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to
the amateurs and the bible grippers. And the gratitude I get is this
charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who

But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You

Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and
trolls.  But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is
'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the
reason you must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone
that is not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family,

then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about
Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ...
this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are now
three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need
it ... badly... So ..   Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out,

disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind. Well, I'm not

doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ...
of the hearts.  And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this

air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. Well, I'm
not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! I'm gonna hang out with these two
smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be
lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. But ... whatever. I agreed
to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man
at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is they want me in it.
If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a
tugboat.  They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners.
In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren
were either driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an
abandoned bridge.  And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't
live in the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where
you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an
option. Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really
flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... So if you think about
it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. It's
... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I
got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. And we are and, I don't know,
winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? ..
Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy
of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass
them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the process. Well, I'm not
Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! There's a new sheriff in town, and he
has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. He's
as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm
... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is
'courage'. And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous
secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway.
Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! And therefore
there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's
where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed in front of the
prom queen. And it's just not an option. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson
.. He was a pussy! 100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one
goes in your mouth. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured
myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession.
It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. But it's just not ... I'm not
fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.  But there's also ... falling
from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with
it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye.   They will lose
the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of
their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge,
somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just
ain't there. WINNING! And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't
live in the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where
you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an
option. There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh,
we must speak of the Vatican assassins. And the gratitude I get is this
charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who
believes he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it.
It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I
don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was
his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today as Major
League.   You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know?
I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity
card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled that
one.   Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with
fools and trolls. Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't
care.  'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to
judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's life.
There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and
it's pure and it's available to everybody. But I dare anyone to debate me
on things. So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with
marriage, with ne'er an excuse. But I dare anyone to debate me on things.

you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that
we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that,
people. See where that goes. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In
fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled that one.  The
goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the
goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ...
but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the
best choice available, right?   And Alex, try to get your mind around this,
as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built
upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total
surrender. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical
fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper
attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and
those people were in their way.  The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses ..
Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good
enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial
descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right?
You know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my
underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these
clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their stupidity and ..
(sighs) I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch
ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.
Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain
Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for
his own selfish exit strategy, bro. Debate me on AA right now. I have a
disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind. You know, they
lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just
look at their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T
PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and
enjoy the show .. You know? Because you have absolute and total resolve
about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence,
there's nothing that can be questioned. And we are and, I don't know,
winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? ..
Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us.  So ... you know ... within that is
tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. They will
lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the
rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a
challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ...
it just ain't there. WINNING! Because ... look at what I'm dealing with,
man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. In fact, a lot of people think the
movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. But like in baseball, the
scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the
heart ... of the hearts. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You
know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my
fingertips.   He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not

gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin
warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. No, you won't get
high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit
panicking. No panic, no judgment. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity
card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled that
one.  Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to
go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but
embarrass them in the process. In fact, a lot of people think the movie's
called 'Wild Thing', as they should.  But there are parts of me that is
hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you
must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because
... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because
they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in all
forms and shapes. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I
just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. 
You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly

around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire
manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of
complete and total surrender.  And that was actually, you know, one of the
few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade.  And
therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle
anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed

you! ... There it is. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured
myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession.

genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody. Yes! I
don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my
precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to
you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. Well,
yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you
can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh
.. And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this
union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and
the bible grippers.  And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work
through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're
gonna fuel my attack.  You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in
front of their ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then
they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never
will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? Um ...
but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely
discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these
... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring
them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing.

it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by

checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know,
effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold. And Alex,

completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I
bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no
reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and
they have nothing. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself
from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just
... It's just the work of sissies. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence
- F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater
watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because
they wanted to and those people were in their way.  100%. You know, here's
your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. The goddesses? Alex, the
goddesses .. Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe
the term is good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by
these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice available,
right? And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job,
which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law. Well,
you've been warned, dude. Bring it.  In fact, a lot of people think the
movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. Yeah, I didn't care about that
vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled
that one. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and
the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay
... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't
know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold.
Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when you
can leave a warning, you know? And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is
'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never
be one of you! ... There it is. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! It's ... yeah ... it's
an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I
got poetry in my fingertips. In fact, a lot of people think the movie's
called 'Wild Thing', as they should. I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it,
as I say. I ain't hidin'. But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not
a soft target. It's over. And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a
fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon
complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total
surrender. It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who
- oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And
it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today
as Major League. And I was getting a tattoo during the death from above.
And it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his
victims. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical
fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper
attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and
those people were in their way. How complicated can it be? What they're not
ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly
gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin
warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. And one of those
stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am
special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is.  Yeah, I didn't
care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and
just dispelled that one. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie.
Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the
hearts. But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is
'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the
reason you must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone
that is not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family,
and they will come at you in all forms and shapes. They urge you to put
down your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I
could locate in their toothless warren were either driving a convertible
van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge. But I dare anyone to
debate me on things. And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't
live in the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where
you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an
option.  And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps!
You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will
deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh ..   Yeah, why not? 'Cause
it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms.  And you know, I'm tired
... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and
just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just
delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. They have zero. They have that
night, and I will forget about them as the last image of them exits my
beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they
will lose. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ...
I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. Yeah, I sat
with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping
pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the
beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way. I am every character in between, save for that little weirdo
with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. I'm gonna hang
out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You
know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. The
goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the
goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ...
but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the
best choice available, right? And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my
deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around
you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry!
WINNING! But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So
what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. But it's
just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. Yeah, I
sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm
dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on
the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job
to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them,
but embarrass them in the process. .. And then, I just got to add this:
There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part
of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about
it: Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and
good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So .. I'm
done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'.  But it's just
not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. Um ... but I'm
excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely discount what
you just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these ... these
turds ... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back
into the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing. But there
are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love,
or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate
violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your
family, because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at
you in all forms and shapes. They have zero. They have that night, and I
will forget about them as the last image of them exits my beautiful home.
And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they will lose. But
it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. And
people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your resentments.'
Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack.  No.
She's not there now. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his
children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't
process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last
decade, I don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans
into pure gold. And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this
includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the
air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh ..  I just
closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous
model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the
work of sissies. And that was actually, you know, one of the few
compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade.   You know,
he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested
bayonets, bro.  You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of
their ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then they look
at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop
trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? There's a new
sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the
Vatican assassins. And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this
includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the
air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. Debate me
on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with
my mind. 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to
judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's life.
There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and
it's pure and it's available to everybody. Yeah, I sat with two - hey,
coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my
movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go
surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way. And the
gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to

Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! And I'm ...

F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my
ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. I just closed my eyes and in a
nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction,
and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. Well, I think
it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it
right. And I'm not ... Because you have absolute and total resolve about
your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence,
there's nothing that can be questioned. But like in baseball, the
scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the
heart ... of the hearts. Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease?
Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind. Yeah, I sat with two -
hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in
my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to
go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way.
Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and
trolls. 100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your
mouth. And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one
of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There
it is. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I
am battle-tested bayonets, bro. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I
cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and
obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies.   So ... you know
... within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous
peace. The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about
the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough
... but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use
the best choice available, right?  I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it,
as I say. I ain't hidin'. And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the
thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican
assassins. They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me
and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ...
again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge.
Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING! There's a new sheriff
in town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican
assassins. They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners.
In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren
were either driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an
abandoned bridge. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a
term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. And if you're a part
of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt
my family, I will murder you violently.  It's being directed and written by
a genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at
23 for writing The Sting. And it was his pen and his vision that created
the classic that we know today as Major League. But ... whatever. I agreed
to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man
at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is they want me in it.
If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a
tugboat. And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior,
deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and
total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total surrender. Check
it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by
healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I
checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know,
effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold.  They
have zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last
image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they
will sell me, and they will lose. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober'
because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself.
Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when you
can leave a warning, you know? But there's also ... falling from it ... is
the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait!
Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. You know? Dealing with soft
targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of
coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time for
their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs) How complicated can it
be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the
other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ...
Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes.
THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! I am every character in between, save for that little
weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. Take
for instance its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down
plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to
find that chapter in his silly book of lies. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! 'You have
the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom.
That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in
that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's
available to everybody.  Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a
pussy! .. And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm
yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just
say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ...

Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause
he got it right. And I'm not ... Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was
a pussy!  And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous
secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway.
Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING!  There's a new
sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the
Vatican assassins. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being
told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull
s.h.i.t. ... uh .. And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't
live in the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where
you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an
option. And that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that

no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show ..
You know?  The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know?
This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics
Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do
the math!  Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not
to completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I
bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no
reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and
they have nothing. But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft
target. It's over. And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically
disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to
the amateurs and the bible grippers.   But it's just not ... I'm not fair
game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. 100%. You know, here's your first
pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. Yeah, I sat with two - hey,
coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my
movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go
surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way. He's as
radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ...
you know ... petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is
'courage'. I am every character in between, save for that little weirdo
with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me.  And they're
gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent
soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just
messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all
have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look
like you're having a lot of fun.  Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in
front of his children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved
mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the

somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just
ain't there. WINNING! The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just
say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ...
is good enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions,
you must use the best choice available, right? And people say, 'Oh, you
know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna
hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. Major League 3? I don't
know. I haven't read it. I don't care.  Yeah, but I can't use the word
'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed
myself. 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to
judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's life.
There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and
it's pure and it's available to everybody.  Yeah, but I can't use the word
'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed
myself. Take for instance its founder and death written ... I don't know
... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I
can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies. And one of those
stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am
special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. In fact, a lot of
people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should.   No. She's
not there now.  THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! No. She's not there now. They urge you
to put down your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only
'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren were either driving a
convertible van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge.   Yeah,
but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people',
and I have cleansed myself. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! You know, they lay down
with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at
their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!'
Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show
.. You know?
He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad,
I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part of me, which
is 'courage'. Because you have absolute and total resolve about your
decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence, there's
nothing that can be questioned. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with,
man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. You know? Dealing with soft
targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of
coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time for
their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs)  Major League 3? I
don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. But there are parts of me that
is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and
you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is
because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family,
because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in
all forms and shapes. No. She's not there now. In fact, a lot of people
think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. And we are and, I
don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with
winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. How complicated can it
be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the
other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ...
Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes.
Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to
completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I
bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no
reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and
they have nothing. Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I
cured it with my brain; with my mind. And one of those stupid mottoes,
Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and
I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. But like in baseball, the
scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the
heart ... of the hearts. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You
know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my
fingertips. And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes
naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I
will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. I'm gonna hang out
with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You
know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. I'm
cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and
frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun. Let me just
say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine
- yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own
selfish exit strategy, bro. And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I
don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's
where you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an
option.  Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to
completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I
bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no
reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and
they have nothing. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself
from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just
... It's just the work of sissies.   There's a new sheriff in town, and he
has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins.  He's
as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm
... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is
'courage'. But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now
is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the
reason you must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone
that is not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family,
and they will come at you in all forms and shapes. The goddesses? Alex, the
goddesses .. Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe
the term is good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by
these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice available,
right? No, you won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit
panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. And we are and, I don't
know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning?
.. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. 'You have the right to kill me,
but you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie.
That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's
genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody. 'You
have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.'
Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's life. There's
nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure
and it's available to everybody.  Because you have absolute and total
resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with
violence, there's nothing that can be questioned. I'm cured. I'm done.
'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you
don't look like you're having a lot of fun. And you know, to sully and to
contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is
something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers.   And
therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle
anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed
in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option. Yeah, I didn't
care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and
just dispelled that one. But there are parts of me that is hopper, because
my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do so
violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because ... and you
have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because they're there to
destroy your family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes. Um
... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely
discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these
... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring
them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing.
Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh,
you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh
..  And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the
middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get
embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option. 100%.
You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. Because
you have absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with
violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be
questioned.  And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in
the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get
embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option. It's
being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't
know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was his
pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today as Major
League. So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with
marriage, with ne'er an excuse. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with,
man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. And the gratitude I get is this
charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who
believes he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it.  I
just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous
model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the
work of sissies. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending
like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second ..
And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every
frickin' turn. But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft
target. It's over. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending
like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second ..
And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every
frickin' turn. You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of
their ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then they look
at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop
trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? Yes! I don't read
anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my precious time on
such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that there
was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. They will lose the rest
of their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of their
lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge,
somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just
ain't there. WINNING! But there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple
from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't
process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. And Alex, try to get your mind around
this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is
built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and
total surrender. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I
went straight on with that one and just dispelled that one.  But there's
also ... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my
life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye.
Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh,
you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh
..  'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to
judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's life.
There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and
it's pure and it's available to everybody.  You know, he might be Nails,
but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. I'm
gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the
world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view,
Alex. So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage,

Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause
he got it right. And I'm not ... So ... you know ... within that is
tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace.  Yeah, why
not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. Yeah. I did.
Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and
embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in
the process. And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes
naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I
will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. Yeah, but I can't use
the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I have
cleansed myself. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an
interview when you can leave a warning, you know? I am every character in
between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for
water. That's not me. But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one
deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great
company - need to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash.
If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. So ... you know ...
within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous
peace. They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my

... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. In fact, a lot of
people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. Check it,
Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing
at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked,
Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know, effortless and
magically converting your tin cans into pure gold. You know? Dealing with
soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first
cup of coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time
for their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs) In fact, a lot of

Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the

only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg
cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now
supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! Yes! I
don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my

coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my
movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go
surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way. And
people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your resentments.'
Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack.  And

They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years
the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren were either
driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge.

Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets,
bro. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools
and trolls.   And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his
job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law.
Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. Major League 3? I don't know. I
haven't read it. I don't care. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm
tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk
about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! Yeah, I sat with
two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping
pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the
beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way. And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous
secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway.
Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! There's a new
sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the
Vatican assassins. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself
from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just
... It's just the work of sissies.   Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity
card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled that
one.  Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not
waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand,
according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican
assassins. Take for instance its founder and death written ... I don't know
... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I
can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies. .. And then, I
just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke
being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is
all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are now three.
Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ...
badly... So ..  And I was getting a tattoo during the death from above.
And it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his
victims. So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with
marriage, with ne'er an excuse. You know, they lay down with their ugly
wives in front of their ugly children and just look at their loser lives
and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you
never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know?
I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'.  How
complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I,
Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are
high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See
where that goes. In fact, a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild
Thing', as they should.   How complicated can it be? What they're not ready
for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons
in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks.
Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. And I was getting a tattoo
during the death from above. And it's the banner from the death card that
Kilgore is throwing on his victims. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! Take for instance
its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist
... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that
chapter in his silly book of lies. They have zero. They have that night,
and I will forget about them as the last image of them exits my beautiful
home. And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they will
lose. 100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your
mouth.  I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this
ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's
just the work of sissies. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired
of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about
that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. 100%. You know, here's your first pee
test. Next one goes in your mouth.   Yes! I don't read anything after it's
come out, because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous
nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of
curiosity about the Vatican assassins. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you
have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them
and they're gonna fuel my attack.  Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you,
I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't
talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh ..  Take for instance its founder
and death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed
high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in
his silly book of lies. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in
here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're
having a lot of fun. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an
interview when you can leave a warning, you know? I'm gonna hang out with
these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it
might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. And people say,
'Oh, you know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm
gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack.    But there are
parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or
you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate
violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your
family, because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at
you in all forms and shapes. So ... you know ... within that is tremendous
focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. They will lose the
rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of
their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge,
somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just
ain't there. WINNING!  Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and
complete gnarlyisms. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I
went straight on with that one and just dispelled that one. But ...
whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson
- a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is
they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd
that opens on a tugboat. But I dare anyone to debate me on things. Let me
just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim
Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his
own selfish exit strategy, bro. But like in baseball, the scoreboard
doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ...
of the hearts.
Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain
Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for
his own selfish exit strategy, bro.  So ... you know ... within that is
tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. But there
are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love,
or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate
violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your
family, because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at
you in all forms and shapes.  I am every character in between, save for
that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not
me. It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I
don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was
his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today as Major
League. There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh,
we must speak of the Vatican assassins. And we are and, I don't know,
winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? ..
Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity
card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled that
one. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch
ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.

they're gonna fuel my attack. So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm
0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. Well, I think it was Nails
that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm
not ... Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical
fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper
attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and
those people were in their way.  They urge you to put down your sword and
come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in
their toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or living like
trolls under an abandoned bridge.  THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! And they're gonna
fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers.
'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing
with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! They will lose the rest of their lives as
they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's

Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for
his own selfish exit strategy, bro. 100%. You know, here's your first pee
test. Next one goes in your mouth.  And therefore there's nothing in the
middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you get
slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen.
And it's just not an option. And you know, to sully and to contaminate or
radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll
leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers.   But like in baseball, the
scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the
heart ... of the hearts. But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a
soft target. It's over. But there's also ... falling from it ... is the
apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't
process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. So if you think about it, dude, it's
like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse.  And if you're a part
of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt
my family, I will murder you violently. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing
shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass people.
Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the process. THE
BIBLE GRIPPERS!  Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and
not to completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if
I bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no
reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and
they have nothing.   Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy!
And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You
know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will
deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. Major League 3? I don't
know. I haven't read it. I don't care. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all
have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look
like you're having a lot of fun. There's a new sheriff in town, and he has
an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. I'm gonna
hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world.
You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. But
there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either

will come at you in all forms and shapes. And we are and, I don't know,
winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? ..
Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. Take for instance its founder and
death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high
on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his
silly book of lies. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a
term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. But I dare anyone to
debate me on things.   Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease?
Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind.  But it's just not ...
I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.  I'm cured. I'm done.
'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you
don't look like you're having a lot of fun. Well, yeah. But I was gonna
tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You
can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh ..  You know? Dealing with
soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first
cup of coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time
for their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs) The only thing I'm
addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know,
arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5%
success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math!  You know, he might be
Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets,
bro. It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh,

The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it.
Losers! WINNING! B'bye. And that was actually, you know, one of the few
compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. Yeah, I sat
with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping
pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the
beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term
from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. Yeah, I didn't care about
that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just
dispelled that one. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm
dealing with fools and trolls. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front
of his children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind
can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last
decade, I don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans
into pure gold. I am every character in between, save for that little
weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. But
there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either
love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you
must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is

pee test. Next one goes in your mouth.  Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell
you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You
can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. And therefore there's

queen. And it's just not an option. .. And then, I just got to add this:

Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and
trolls.
But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all
have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. He's as radical as you'd
think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ...
petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. And
Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the
trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender
... or the concept of complete and total surrender. How complicated can it
be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the
other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ...

Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses

good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these

Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my

If you love with violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that

That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's
genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody. They
will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for
the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a
challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ...
it just ain't there. WINNING! Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm
tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk
about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh ..
And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the
Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins. They urge you to put down
your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I
could locate in their toothless warren were either driving a convertible
van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge. And they're gonna fuel
the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers.
'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing
with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of
that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass
them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the process.  Yeah, I sat
with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping
pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the
beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way. He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not
just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part
of me, which is 'courage'. But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not
a soft target. It's over.  I am every character in between, save for that
little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me.
And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) ..
Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us.  So if you
think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an
excuse. No. She's not there now.   Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of
that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass
them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the process. And you know,
to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a
shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible
grippers. Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to
completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I
bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no
reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and
they have nothing. And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to
do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above
the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. Because I'm just ... um
.. I don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you
know? But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what
we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts.   But ...
whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson
- a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is
they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd
that opens on a tugboat. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man.
I'm dealing with fools and trolls. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you,
I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't
talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. I just closed my eyes and in a
nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction,
and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. In fact, a lot
of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. I am every
character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped
in, begging for water. That's not me. Yes! I don't read anything after it's
come out, because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous
nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of
curiosity about the Vatican assassins.  'You have the right to kill me, but
you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie.
That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's
genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody. But
like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all
have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. Major League 3? I don't
know. I haven't read it. I don't care.  In fact, a lot of people think the
movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should.  Because I'm just ... um ..
I don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know?
It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry,
man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. But ... whatever. I
agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a
wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is they
want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that
opens on a tugboat. And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't
live in the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where
you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an
option. They have zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them
as the last image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out
there and they will sell me, and they will lose. Yes! I don't read anything
after it's come out, because I will not waste my precious time on such
ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that there was a
lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. Take for instance its founder
and death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed
high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in
his silly book of lies. So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm
0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed
him in front of his children and the world by healing at a pace that his
unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent
close to the last decade, I don't know, effortless and magically converting
your tin cans into pure gold. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin'
bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. And we are and, I
don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with
winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. He's as radical as you'd
think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ...
petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. But
it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. But
there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either
love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you
must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is
not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family, and they
will come at you in all forms and shapes. Because you have absolute and
total resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate
with violence, there's nothing that can be questioned. And I'm ... you know
... most of the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro.
And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the
ground. And, uh .. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I
just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. 
And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the
Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins. And people say, 'Oh, you
know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna
hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. Yeah, but I can't use the
word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed
myself.  No. She's not there now. And you know, to sully and to contaminate
or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something
I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers.  And the gratitude I get
is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly,
someone who believes he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude.
Bring it. Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really
flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... Because ... look at what
I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. Check it, Alex, I
embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing at a pace
that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've
spent close to the last decade, I don't know, effortless and magically
converting your tin cans into pure gold. I am every character in between,
save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water.
That's not me. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has.
So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. I'm
cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and
frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.  Yes! I don't
read anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my precious
time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that
there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. Well, yeah. But I
was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about
that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. THE BIBLE
GRIPPERS!   And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long
silence) .. Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be
us. And that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown
has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. But like in baseball, the
scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the
heart ... of the hearts. Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um
... and not to completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just
that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ...
there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have
real fame, and they have nothing. I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin'
hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up
here, but I sure like the view, Alex. How complicated can it be? What
they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other
gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican
assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. And if
you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate
and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently. And the gratitude I
get is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly,
someone who believes he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude.
Bring it.
THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his
children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't
process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last
decade, I don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans
into pure gold. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children
and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process.
Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I
don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure
gold. And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep
in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and total
surrender ... or the concept of complete and total surrender.  You know?
Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear
before my first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I
don't have time for their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs) And
if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate
and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently.   And you know, to
sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful
contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers.
.. And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm
yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just
say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ...
there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ...
you're gonna need it ... badly... So .. No. She's not there now. Yeah, I
sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm
dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on
the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from
this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ...
It's just the work of sissies. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of
pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every
second .. And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods
at every frickin' turn. And you know, to sully and to contaminate or
radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll
leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers. There's a new sheriff in
town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican
assassins. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from
this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ...
It's just the work of sissies. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ...
pure and complete gnarlyisms. I am every character in between, save for
that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not
me. And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle
anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed

Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out
there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but
embarrass them in the process.  The only thing I'm addicted to right now is
winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as
'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is
100%. Do the math!  And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and
dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you ..
Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! Debate
me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain;
with my mind. .. And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole
firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And
let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there
were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your
travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So ..  But there's also ...
falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life.
Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye.  But like
in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is
a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. You know, he might be Nails, but
I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro.   'You
have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.'
Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's life. There's

So .. But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is

reason you must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone
that is not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family,

broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I
can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies. It's being
directed and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't know -
won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was his pen and
his vision that created the classic that we know today as Major League. You
know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children
and just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I
CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back
and enjoy the show .. You know? Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in
front of his children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved
mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the
last decade, I don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin

is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my
life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom.
Print that, people. See where that goes. So ... you know ... within that is
tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. I'm gonna
hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world.
You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex.  And
therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle

charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who
believes he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. 
Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain
Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for
his own selfish exit strategy, bro.  And I was getting a tattoo during the
death from above. And it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is
throwing on his victims. Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out,
because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But
I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the
Vatican assassins.
Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to

Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show

targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of

the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their
toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or living like
trolls under an abandoned bridge. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity
card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled that
one.  He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my
dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part of me,
which is 'courage'. I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I
ain't hidin'. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through
your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna
fuel my attack. He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm
not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill another
part of me, which is 'courage'. They have zero. They have that night, and I
will forget about them as the last image of them exits my beautiful home.
And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they will lose. But
there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree.
There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING!
B'bye. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy!  They have zero.
They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last image of
them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will

It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry,
man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. No, you won't get high
.. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No
panic, no judgment. 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the
right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's
life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal
and it's pure and it's available to everybody. And one of those stupid
mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am
special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. And I'm like ...
guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder
people. We're Vatican assassins. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know.
Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know? 'You have the
right to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's
the whole movie. That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that.
There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available

because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself.  No,
you won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking.
Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. And Alex, try to get your mind
around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire
manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of
complete and total surrender. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is
winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as
'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is
100%. Do the math! Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ...
and not to completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just
that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ...
there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have
real fame, and they have nothing. But it's just not ... I'm not fair game.
I'm not a soft target. It's over. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired
of pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning
every second .. And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the
goods at every frickin' turn.  The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let
me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good
enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial
descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right? And Alex, try
to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches:
Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or
the concept of complete and total surrender. And that was actually, you
know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost
a decade. It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who -
oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And
it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today
as Major League. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun,
radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the
chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted
to and those people were in their way.  Take for instance its founder and
death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high
on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his
silly book of lies. I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I
ain't hidin'.   How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is
guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my
life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom.
Print that, people. See where that goes. 'You have the right to kill me,
but you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie.
That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's
genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody. It's
... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I
got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. Yeah. I did. Because he's
nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass
people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the
process. It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who -
oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And
it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today
as Major League.    You know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just
strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't
have time for these clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their
stupidity and .. (sighs) Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it.
I don't care. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You
know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics
Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do
the math! And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the
middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get
embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option.  Yeah,
but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people',
and I have cleansed myself. Because you have absolute and total resolve
about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence,
there's nothing that can be questioned. Take for instance its founder and
death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high
on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his
silly book of lies. Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ...
and not to completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just
that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ...
there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have
real fame, and they have nothing.  .. And then, I just got to add this:
There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part
of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about
it: Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and
good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So ..
Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care.  And we are
and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with
winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. So if you think about
it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse.  Yeah.
I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there
and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass
them in the process. Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I
don't care.  You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you
know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. You know, he might be Nails, but
I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro.
You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am
battle-tested bayonets, bro. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is
winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as
'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is
100%. Do the math! No. She's not there now. There's a new sheriff in town,
and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican
assassins. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you
know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. How complicated can it be? What
they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other
gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican
assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. Because
I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave
a warning, you know? And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? ..
(long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would
be us. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm
sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. Yeah, but I
can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I
have cleansed myself. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it
is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just
beat them, but embarrass them in the process.  Because ... look at what I'm
dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. How complicated can
it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all
the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ...
Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes.
But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You
either love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason
you must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that
is not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family, and
they will come at you in all forms and shapes. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well,
we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't
look like you're having a lot of fun. Well, I think it was Nails that said
I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ...  I
am every character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts
strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. And that was actually, you
know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost
a decade. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my
life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm
not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin'
turn. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the
world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ...
last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know,
effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold. And I'm
... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an
F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my
ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. 'You have the right to kill me, but
you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie.
That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's
genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody. Let me
just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim
Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his
own selfish exit strategy, bro.  And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have
to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and
they're gonna fuel my attack. They will lose the rest of their lives as
they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's
... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a
frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING! 
Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my
brain; with my mind. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm
dealing with fools and trolls. No. She's not there now. Yeah, I sat with
two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping
pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the
beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way. They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me
and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ...
again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge.
Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING! So ... you know ...
within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous
peace. And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work
for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins. I'm done. I'm
done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'.  And people say, 'Oh,
you know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna
hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. But like in baseball, the
scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the
heart ... of the hearts. And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly
and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you
.. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING!
THE BIBLE GRIPPERS!  And if you're a part of my family, I will love you
violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you
violently. Because you have absolute and total resolve about your
decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence, there's
nothing that can be questioned. I am every character in between, save for
that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not
me. And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for
the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins. But I dare anyone to
debate me on things. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his
children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't
process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last
decade, I don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans
into pure gold. 100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes
in your mouth.  But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft
target. It's over. And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to
do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above
the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. Um ... but I'm excited
to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely discount what you
just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds
... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back into
the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing. Take for
instance its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down
plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to
find that chapter in his silly book of lies. And people say, 'Oh, you
know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna
hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. And you know, to sully
and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful
contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers.
And that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has
paid me in frickin' almost a decade.  The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses
.. Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is
good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these
terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right?  
You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am
battle-tested bayonets, bro. Let me just say this: It's nothing this side
of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name
- mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro. They have
zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last image
of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will
sell me, and they will lose. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a
pussy! I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. 
And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.'
News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is.
Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. But
like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all
have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. Let me just say this:
It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah,
that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit
strategy, bro. But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal
point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company
- need to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they
don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. So if you think about it, dude,
it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. The goddesses?
Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't
believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're
bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice
available, right?  So ... you know ... within that is tremendous focus, and
tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. He's as radical as you'd think
he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up
the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. And one of those
stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am
special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is.  I am every
character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped
in, begging for water. That's not me. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you
have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them

care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and
just dispelled that one. So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm
0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. And I was getting a tattoo
during the death from above. And it's the banner from the death card that
Kilgore is throwing on his victims. There's a new sheriff in town, and he
has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. I'm
gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the
world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view,
Alex. And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence)
.. Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. There's
a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak
of the Vatican assassins. In fact, a lot of people think the movie's called
'Wild Thing', as they should. But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm
not a soft target. It's over. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of

That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's
genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody.  
Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire,
napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack
sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those
people were in their way. 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not

gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the
world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view,
Alex.   Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not
waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand,
according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican
assassins.  And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his
job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law.
Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it.  Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just
pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms.  So ... you know ... within that is
tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. You know,
they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and
just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T
PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and
enjoy the show .. You know? Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure
and complete gnarlyisms. Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of
deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name -
mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro. No, you
won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking.
Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't
know. Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know? He's as

gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about
that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. I just closed
my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of
disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of
sissies. Take for instance its founder and death written ... I don't know
... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I
can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies.  I am every
character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped

charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who
believes he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. You
know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my
underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these
clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their stupidity and ..

because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But
I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the
Vatican assassins.  And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this
includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the
air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh ..  Because
... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls.
It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry,
man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. And if you're a part of
my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my
family, I will murder you violently. And if you're a part of my family, I
will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I
will murder you violently. Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease?
Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind. How complicated can it
be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the
other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ...
Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes.
You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am
battle-tested bayonets, bro.  They urge you to put down your sword and come
join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their
toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or living like
trolls under an abandoned bridge. In fact, a lot of people think the
movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. I am every character in
between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for
water. That's not me. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in
here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're
having a lot of fun. No, you won't get high .. It's all good. It's all
good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment.  Yeah,
why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms.  And
people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your resentments.'
Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. Um
... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely
discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these
... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring
them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing. I
just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous
model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the
work of sissies. Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I
cured it with my brain; with my mind. The only thing I'm addicted to right
now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred
to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success
rate is 100%. Do the math!  Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work.

You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my
fingertips.  It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward
who - oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting.
And it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know
today as Major League.  But there's also ... falling from it ... is the
apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't
process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't
read it. I don't care. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin'
bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. And you know, I'm
tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect and
bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect and
bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. But there
are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love,
or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate
violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your
family, because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at
you in all forms and shapes. There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an
army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins.  Check it,
Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing
at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked,
Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know, effortless and
magically converting your tin cans into pure gold. Because ... look at what
I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. It's being
directed and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't know -
won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was his pen and
his vision that created the classic that we know today as Major League.
Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when you
can leave a warning, you know? Well, I think it was Nails that said I was
really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... But like
in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is
a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts.  And Alex, try to get your mind
around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire
manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of
complete and total surrender.   But there are parts of me that is hopper,

(long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would
be us. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical
fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper
attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and
those people were in their way. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm
tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk
about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh ..   And that was actually, you know,
one of the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a
decade. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So

assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes.  They
will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for
the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a
challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ...
it just ain't there. WINNING! The only thing I'm addicted to right now is
winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as
'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is
100%. Do the math! And I was getting a tattoo during the death from above.
And it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his
victims. Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it
with my brain; with my mind. I am every character in between, save for that
little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me.
And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in
the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and total

'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.'
Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's life. There's
nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure
and it's available to everybody.  Because I'm just ... um .. I don't

Jefferson .. He was a pussy! You know, he might be Nails, but I'm
frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. Yeah, I
didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that
one and just dispelled that one.  You know, they lay down with their ugly
wives in front of their ugly children and just look at their loser lives
and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you
never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know?
Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out
there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but
embarrass them in the process. No, you won't get high .. It's all good.
It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment.

magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. They have zero. They have that
night, and I will forget about them as the last image of them exits my
beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they
will lose. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and

my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all
around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry!
WINNING! But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point
that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need
to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't,
it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. Yeah, I sat with two - hey,
coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my
movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go

certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock
star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro. And therefore there's nothing
in the middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you get
slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen.
And it's just not an option. I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin'
hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up
here, but I sure like the view, Alex.  100%. You know, here's your first
pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. And they're gonna fuel the
battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause
they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one
dude. Sorry! WINNING!   You know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just
strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't
have time for these clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their
stupidity and .. (sighs) So ... you know ... within that is tremendous
focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. Let me just say this:

are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love,
or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate
violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your
family, because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at
you in all forms and shapes.  And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to
work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and
they're gonna fuel my attack. And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is
'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never
be one of you! ... There it is. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! And
you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't
perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect
and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. Take
for instance its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down
plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to
find that chapter in his silly book of lies. No, you won't get high ..
It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No
panic, no judgment.  I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here
and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a
lot of fun. No. She's not there now.  And I'm like ... guys, it's right
there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're
Vatican assassins. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I
just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. 
And I was getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's the banner
from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims.  .. And
then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about
Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ...
this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are now
three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need
it ... badly... So .. It's being directed and written by a genius name
David Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing
The Sting. And it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that
we know today as Major League. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement.
You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my
fingertips. 100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in
your mouth. And I was getting a tattoo during the death from above. And
it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his
victims.  But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point
that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need
to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't,
it's a turd that opens on a tugboat.  But like in baseball, the scoreboard
doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ...
of the hearts. In fact, a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild
Thing', as they should. Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I
don't care. And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently.
If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently.
I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves
and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun. It's
being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't
know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was his
pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today as Major
League. And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous
secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway.
Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING!  And I'm like
... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We
murder people. We're Vatican assassins. I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring
it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm
not a soft target. It's over. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of
that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass
them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the process. I am every
character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped
in, begging for water. That's not me. Because ... look at what I'm dealing
with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. And they're gonna fuel the
battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause
they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one
dude. Sorry! WINNING! But there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple
from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't
process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. Take for instance its founder and death
written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid
until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book
of lies.  They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and
my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again,
bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you
know ... it just ain't there. WINNING!  I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring
it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence -
F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater
watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because
they wanted to and those people were in their way. Major League 3? I don't
know. I haven't read it. I don't care. But like in baseball, the scoreboard
doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ...
of the hearts. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun,
radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the

to and those people were in their way. I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring
it, as I say. I ain't hidin'.  And if you're a part of my family, I will
love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will
murder you violently. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy!
So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with
ne'er an excuse. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm
dealing with fools and trolls. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS!    I am every character
in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging
for water. That's not me. But there's also ... falling from it ... is the
apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't
process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry
of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all
around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry!
WINNING! And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps!
You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will
deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh ..  Yeah, I sat with two -
hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in
my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to
go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way. And
if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate

two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping
pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the
beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way.    Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and
not to completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if
I bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no
reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and
they have nothing. So ... you know ... within that is tremendous focus, and
tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace.  How complicated can it be? What
they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other
gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican
assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. So ...
you know ... within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and
tremendous peace. And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and
dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you ..
Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING!   And
Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the
trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender
... or the concept of complete and total surrender. You know, they lay down
with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at
their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!'
Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show
.. You know? Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! Take for
instance its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down
plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to
find that chapter in his silly book of lies.  But there's also ... falling
from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with

stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am
special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. No. She's not there
now. There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we
must speak of the Vatican assassins. And I'm like ... guys, it's right
there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're
Vatican assassins. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! There's a new sheriff in town, and
he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. 
There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must
speak of the Vatican assassins. So if you think about it, dude, it's like
I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. It's ... yeah ... it's an
understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got
poetry in my fingertips. And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose
not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is
above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. It's being
directed and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't know -

warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. And therefore
there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's
where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed in front of the
prom queen. And it's just not an option. But it's just not ... I'm not fair
game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.  And we are and, I don't know,
winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? ..
Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. So if you think about it, dude, it's
like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse.  So if you think
about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse.
But I dare anyone to debate me on things.
I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around
the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view,
Alex. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete
gnarlyisms.  No. She's not there now. No, you won't get high .. It's all
good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no
judgment. The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this
about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good
enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you
must use the best choice available, right? And therefore there's nothing in
the middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you get
slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen.
And it's just not an option. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that.
And it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not
just beat them, but embarrass them in the process. And we are and, I don't

pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. How complicated can it be? What
they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other
gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican
assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. So ...
you know ... within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and
tremendous peace. So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3
with marriage, with ne'er an excuse.   Because I'm just ... um .. I don't
know. Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know?  He's
as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm
... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is
'courage'. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy!  And we are
and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with
winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. You know? Dealing with
soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first
cup of coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time
for their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs) Because I'm just
... um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave a
warning, you know? And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't
live in the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where
you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an

isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not
perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn.
But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You
either love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason
you must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that
is not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family, and
they will come at you in all forms and shapes. And they're gonna fuel the
battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause
they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one
dude. Sorry! WINNING!  Because you have absolute and total resolve about
your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence,
there's nothing that can be questioned. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him
in front of his children and the world by healing at a pace that his
unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent
close to the last decade, I don't know, effortless and magically converting
your tin cans into pure gold.  It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement.
You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my
fingertips. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know?
This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics
Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do
the math!  In fact, a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing',
as they should. Take for instance its founder and death written ... I don't
know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he
died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies.   You
know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am
battle-tested bayonets, bro. 100%. You know, here's your first pee test.
Next one goes in your mouth.  The only thing I'm addicted to right now is

they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat.
But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.
It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry,
man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips.  Well, I think it was
Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And
I'm not ... 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right
to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's life.
There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and
it's pure and it's available to everybody. So if you think about it, dude,
it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. And the
gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to
WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law. Well, you've been
warned, dude. Bring it. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured
myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession.
It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. And they're gonna fuel the
battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause
they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one

the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican
assassins. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical
fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper
attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and
those people were in their way. The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let
me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good
enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial
descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right? No. She's not
there now. And that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that
clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. Because I'm just ... um ..
I don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know?
I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around

It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers
... there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have
real fame, and they have nothing. And you know, to sully and to contaminate
or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something
I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers.
They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years
the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren were either
driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge.
Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! Yeah, I didn't care
about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just
dispelled that one.  No. She's not there now.  And I'm ... you know ...
most of the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I
will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground.

just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips.
Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh,
you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh
.. But there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving
Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers!
WINNING! B'bye. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You
know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics
Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do
the math! Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it
with my brain; with my mind. And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And
this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in
the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. So if
you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er
an excuse. Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care.
But I dare anyone to debate me on things. 'You have the right to kill me,
but you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie.
That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's
genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody. You
know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my
underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these
clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their stupidity and ..
(sighs) How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like
you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that
we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that,
people. See where that goes. And that was actually, you know, one of the
few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. THE
BIBLE GRIPPERS! The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You
know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics
Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do
the math! I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'.
And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.'
News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is.
You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am
battle-tested bayonets, bro. And that was actually, you know, one of the
few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. But
there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree.
There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING!
B'bye. But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's
over.  No. She's not there now. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was
a pussy! Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really
flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ...  Because ... look at
what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. But there's
also ... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my
life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. And
I was getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's the banner
from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims. And I'm ...
you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an
F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my
ordinance to the ground. And, uh ..  They urge you to put down your sword
and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in
their toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or living like
trolls under an abandoned bridge. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have
to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and
they're gonna fuel my attack. You know, they lay down with their ugly wives
in front of their ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then
they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never
will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? Check
it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by
healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I
checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know,
effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold. And the
gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to
WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law. Well, you've been
warned, dude. Bring it. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And
it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not
just beat them, but embarrass them in the process. Yeah, why not? 'Cause
it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. And one of those stupid
mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am
special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. 'You have the right
to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the
whole movie. That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that.
There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available
to everybody. I am every character in between, save for that little weirdo
with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me.  Well, I'm not
Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring
it, as I say. I ain't hidin'.  It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement.
You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my
fingertips. How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys
like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ...
that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that,
people. See where that goes. And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my
deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around
you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry!
WINNING! There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins.
Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. Debate me on AA right now. I
have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind.
They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years
the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren were either
driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge.
But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all
have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. And people say, 'Oh, you
know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna
hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack.   I'm done. I'm done.
It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. Because ... look at what I'm
dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. It's ... yeah ...
it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic

he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested
bayonets, bro. Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable,
that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this
rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro.  Take for instance its
founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ...
stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that
chapter in his silly book of lies. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober'
because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. The
only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg
cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now

know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am
battle-tested bayonets, bro. Yes! I don't read anything after it's come
out, because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense.
But I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about
the Vatican assassins. I am every character in between, save for that
little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. 
Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care.  But there's

and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying.
Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? I'm done. I'm done. It's
on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'.  And if you're a part of my family,
I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I
will murder you violently. But there are parts of me that is hopper,
because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do
so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because ... and
you have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because they're there
to destroy your family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes. 
He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad,
I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part of me, which
is 'courage'. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! They will
lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the
rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a
challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ...
it just ain't there. WINNING! And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to
work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and
they're gonna fuel my attack. And Alex, try to get your mind around this,
as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built
upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total
surrender. Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not
to completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I
bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no
reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and
they have nothing. They have zero. They have that night, and I will forget
about them as the last image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will
get out there and they will sell me, and they will lose.  Yeah. I did.
Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and
embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in
the process. 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right
to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's life.
There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and
it's pure and it's available to everybody. Because I'm just ... um .. I
don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know?
And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) ..
Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us.  Well, yeah.
But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk
about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. They have
zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last image

winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. Well, I'm not Thomas
Jefferson .. He was a pussy! I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I
cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and
obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. How complicated can
it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all
the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ...
Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes.
They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years
the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren were either
driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge. 
So ... you know ... within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous
clarity, and tremendous peace. And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my
deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around
you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry!
WINNING! .. And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm
yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just
say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ...
there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ...
you're gonna need it ... badly... So .. It's ... yeah ... it's an
understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got
poetry in my fingertips. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work
through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're

violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because ... and you
have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because they're there to
destroy your family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes.
Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire,
napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack
sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those
people were in their way. But there are parts of me that is hopper, because
my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do so
violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because ... and you
have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because they're there to
destroy your family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes.  
'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.'
Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's life. There's
nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure
and it's available to everybody. No, you won't get high .. It's all good.
It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment.
You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly
children and just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and
say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just
sit back and enjoy the show .. You know?  I am every character in
between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for
water. That's not me. Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I
don't care. But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal
point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company
- need to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they
don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. Take for instance its founder
and death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed
high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in
his silly book of lies. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In
fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled that one. And one
of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News
flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is.  Yeah.
I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there

And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the
Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins.   So if you think about
it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. But
it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. THE

good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these
terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right? 
'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.'

Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by
healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I
checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know,
effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold. The

focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. I'm gonna hang out
with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You
know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. Because
I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave

There it is. And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically
disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to
the amateurs and the bible grippers.  They urge you to put down your sword
and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winner..ies. Toffee ate in
their toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or living like
trolls under an abandoned bridge. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired
of pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning
every second .. And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the
goods at every frickin' turn. And that was actually, you know, one of the
few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. The
goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the
goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ...
but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the
best choice available, right? You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin'
bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. Yeah, why not? 'Cause
it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms.
And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't
perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect
and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. But
it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.  Um
... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely
discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these
... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring
them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing.
I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves
and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.   Yes! I
don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my
precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to
you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. But ...
whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson
- a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is
they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd
that opens on a tugboat.  I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties
and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up here,
but I sure like the view, Alex. Debate me on AA right now. I have a
disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind. But I dare
anyone to debate me on things. But there are parts of me that is hopper,
because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do
so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because ... and
you have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because they're there
to destroy your family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes. 
Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. 
Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire,
napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack
sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those
people were in their way.   They have zero. They have that night, and I
will forget about them as the last image of them exits my beautiful home.
And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they will lose. And
you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union
with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the
bible grippers. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is
his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat
them, but embarrass them in the process. And the gratitude I get is this
charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who
believes he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. And
you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union
with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the
bible grippers. You know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing
runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have
time for these clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their
stupidity and .. (sighs) There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an
army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. Let me just
say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine
- yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own
selfish exit strategy, bro. 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not
have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life ..
That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's
crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody. And they're gonna
fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers.
'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing
with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober'
because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself.
Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire,
napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack
sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those
people were in their way. So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm
0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. Because you have absolute and
total resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate
with violence, there's nothing that can be questioned. And people say, 'Oh,
you know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna
hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. And if you're a part of
my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my
family, I will murder you violently. Because you have absolute and total
resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with
violence, there's nothing that can be questioned. But there's also ...
falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life.
Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. And that
was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me
in frickin' almost a decade.  And I was getting a tattoo during the death
from above. And it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is
throwing on his victims.  But I dare anyone to debate me on things. But
like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all
have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. How complicated can it
be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the
other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ...
Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes.
Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those
people', and I have cleansed myself. It's being directed and written by a

Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? And that was actually, you

a decade.   Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because I will
not waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand,
according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican
assassins. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know?
This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics
Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do
the math! Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from
'those people', and I have cleansed myself. But it's just not ... I'm not
fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. Because ... look at what I'm
dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. And we are and, I
don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with
winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. But there are parts of
me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate

is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family,
because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in

they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and

were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! They urge you to put down
your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I
could locate in their toothless warren were either driving a convertible

that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that,

That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's

just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke
being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is
all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are now three.
Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ...
badly... So ..  But there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple

I ain't hidin'. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! So if
you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er
an excuse. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical
fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper
attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and
those people were in their way. And I was getting a tattoo during the death

And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you
infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently. Check
it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by
healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I
checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know,
effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold. Yeah, I
didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that
one and just dispelled that one. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with,
man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls.  Take for instance its founder and
death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high

silly book of lies. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top
Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the
chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted
to and those people were in their way. And you know, to sully and to
contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is
something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers. But ...
whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson
- a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is
they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd
that opens on a tugboat. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in
here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're
having a lot of fun. But there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple
from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't
process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. 100%. You know, here's your first pee
test. Next one goes in your mouth. .. And then, I just got to add this:
There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part
of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about
it: Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and
good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So .. You
know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am
battle-tested bayonets, bro. And that was actually, you know, one of the
few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. But
like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all
have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. Yeah, why not? 'Cause
it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. And people say, 'Oh, you
know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna
hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. You know, he might be
Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets,
bro. .. And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm
yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just
say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ...
there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ...
you're gonna need it ... badly... So .. Let me just say this: It's
nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's
Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit
strategy, bro. You know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing
runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have
time for these clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their
stupidity and .. (sighs) Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why
give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know? The only thing
I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you
know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5%
success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! But I dare anyone to
debate me on things. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of
being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about
that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. 100%. You know, here's your first pee
test. Next one goes in your mouth.  But there are parts of me that is
hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you
must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because
... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because
they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in all
forms and shapes.
Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to
completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I
bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no
reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and
they have nothing. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun,
radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the
chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted
to and those people were in their way. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in
front of his children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved
mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the
last decade, I don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin
cans into pure gold. He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ...
I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill
another part of me, which is 'courage'. So ... you know ... within that is
tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. But it's
just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. Yeah. I
did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there
and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass
them in the process. 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have
the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life ..
That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's
crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody.  So ... you know ...
within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous
peace. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this
ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's
just the work of sissies. He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If
... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill
another part of me, which is 'courage'.  I just closed my eyes and in a
nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction,
and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. And they're
gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent
soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just
messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! And you know, to sully and to
contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is
something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers.  And Alex, try
to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches:
Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or
the concept of complete and total surrender. In fact, a lot of people think
the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. But ... whatever. I agreed
to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man
at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is they want me in it.
If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a
tugboat.  How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys
like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ...
that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that,
people. See where that goes. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a
pussy!   It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm
sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. And Alex, try to
get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their
entire manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the
concept of complete and total surrender. You know, they lay down with their
ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at their loser
lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and
you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You
know? And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps!
You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will
deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. There's a new sheriff in
town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican
assassins. Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured
it with my brain; with my mind. And therefore there's nothing in the
middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you get
slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen.
And it's just not an option.   And you know, to sully and to contaminate or
radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll
leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers. Yeah, I sat with two - hey,
coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my
movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go
surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way. But it's
just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. Because
you have absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with
violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be
questioned. And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in
the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get
embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option. Um ...
but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely
discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these
... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring
them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing.
Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause
he got it right. And I'm not ... Because ... look at what I'm dealing with,
man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. I'm gonna hang out with these two
smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be
lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. But like in baseball, the
scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the
heart ... of the hearts.  Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and
complete gnarlyisms. And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? ..
(long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would
be us. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this
ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's
just the work of sissies.  He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If
... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill
another part of me, which is 'courage'. The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses
.. Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is
good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these
terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right?
And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you
infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently. 100%.
You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. Debate
me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain;
with my mind. Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I
cured it with my brain; with my mind.  The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses
.. Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is
good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these
terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right?
And I was getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's the banner
from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims. No. She's not
there now. And I was getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's
the banner from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims.   
Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those
people', and I have cleansed myself.    They have zero. They have that
night, and I will forget about them as the last image of them exits my
beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they
will lose. But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now
is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the
reason you must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone
that is not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family,
and they will come at you in all forms and shapes. Yeah. I did. Because
he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass
people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the
process. Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not
waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand,
according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican
assassins. They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners.
In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren
were either driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an
abandoned bridge. And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow
warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon
complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total
surrender. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went
straight on with that one and just dispelled that one. I'm cured. I'm done.
'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you
don't look like you're having a lot of fun. But it's just not ... I'm not
fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. But there are parts of me that
is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and
you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is
because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family,
because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in
all forms and shapes.  But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie.
Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the
hearts. I am every character in between, save for that little weirdo with
his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. Yeah, I sat with
two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping
pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the
beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! Let me just say this: It's nothing this side
of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name
- mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro. Yeah, I
sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm
dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on
the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way.

League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. You know, they lay
down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at
their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!'
Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show
.. You know? And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like
my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And
I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every
frickin' turn. 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the
right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's
life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal

add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you

So .. And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If
you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently.
100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth.
And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this
union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and
the bible grippers. But I dare anyone to debate me on things. They will
lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the
rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a
challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ...
it just ain't there. WINNING! Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober'
because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. 'You
have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.'
Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's life. There's

me in frickin' almost a decade. They have zero. They have that night, and I
will forget about them as the last image of them exits my beautiful home.
And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they will lose.  So
if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with
ne'er an excuse. And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and
dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you ..
Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! You
know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children

also ... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my
life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. And
the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to
WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law. Well, you've been
warned, dude. Bring it. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And
it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not

That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's
crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody. The only thing I'm
addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know,
arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5%
success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math!  It's being directed
and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the
Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was his pen and his
vision that created the classic that we know today as Major League. Yeah, I
sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm
dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on

So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with

I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. I just closed my eyes

addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. But
it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. And
one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.'
News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. 
But I dare anyone to debate me on things.  In fact, a lot of people think
the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. Because I'm just ... um
.. I don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you

And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is

agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a
wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is they
want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that
opens on a tugboat. I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and
fly privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I
sure like the view, Alex. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! You know, he might be Nails,
but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. But
there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either
love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you
must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is
not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family, and they
will come at you in all forms and shapes. Yeah, but I can't use the word
'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed
myself. Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to
completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I
bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no
reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and
they have nothing. And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow
warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon
complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total
surrender. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know?
This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics
Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do
the math! Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it
with my brain; with my mind. Well, I think it was Nails that said I was
really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ...   Because
you have absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with
violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be
questioned. And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We
work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins. They have
zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last image
of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will
sell me, and they will lose. They have zero. They have that night, and I
will forget about them as the last image of them exits my beautiful home.
And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they will lose.
Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. 
Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause
he got it right. And I'm not ... I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as
I say. I ain't hidin'. Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I
don't care. And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically
disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to
the amateurs and the bible grippers. So if you think about it, dude, it's
like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. He's as radical as
you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ...
petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. Yeah,
I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that
one and just dispelled that one. And Alex, try to get your mind around
this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is
built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and
total surrender. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a
term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. .. And then, I just
got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being,
you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm
gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye,
Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly...
So ..   He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just
my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part of
me, which is 'courage'. And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I
don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's
where you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an
option.  And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior,
deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and
total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total surrender. ..
And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday
about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this
... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are
now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna
need it ... badly... So .. Because you have absolute and total resolve
about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence,
there's nothing that can be questioned.  I'm gonna hang out with these two
smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be
lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. Yeah, I didn't care about
that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just
dispelled that one. And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and
dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you ..
Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING!  And
you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union
with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the
bible grippers. It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward
who - oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting.
And it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know
today as Major League. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give
an interview when you can leave a warning, you know? And therefore there's
nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you
get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed in front of the prom
queen. And it's just not an option. Take for instance its founder and death
written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid
until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book
of lies. They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners. In
22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren were
either driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an abandoned
bridge.  And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous
secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway.
Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING!  The only
thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult -
you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a
5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math!   And one of those
stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am
special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. How complicated can
it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all
the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ...
Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes.
And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this
union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and
the bible grippers. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and
complete gnarlyisms. .. And then, I just got to add this: There was a
whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew.
And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where
there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in
your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So .. Because ... look
at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. And you
know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect
and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect and
bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn.  And one of
those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News
flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. But I
dare anyone to debate me on things.  And I'm ... you know ... most of the
time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will
destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And,
uh ..  I am every character in between, save for that little weirdo with
his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. And that was
actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me in
frickin' almost a decade. I am every character in between, save for that
little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me.
I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around
the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view,
Alex.  Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. 
Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on
with that one and just dispelled that one.
Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire,
napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack
sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those
people were in their way.  And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the
thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican
assassins. Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not
to completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I
bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no
reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and
they have nothing. There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of
assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. Let me just say
this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine -
yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish
exit strategy, bro.  Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an
interview when you can leave a warning, you know? You know, he might be
Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets,
bro. But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You
either love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason
you must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that
is not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family, and
they will come at you in all forms and shapes.  Yeah, I didn't care about
that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just
dispelled that one.  No, you won't get high .. It's all good. It's all
good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. But
there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree.
There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING!
B'bye. No, you won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit
panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment.  So if you think about
it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. Debate
me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain;
with my mind.  But there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple from
The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it.
Losers! WINNING! B'bye. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And
it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not
just beat them, but embarrass them in the process. And I'm like ... guys,
it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people.
We're Vatican assassins. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work
through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're
gonna fuel my attack. No, you won't get high .. It's all good. It's all
good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. Yeah, I
didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that
one and just dispelled that one. It's being directed and written by a
genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23
for writing The Sting. And it was his pen and his vision that created the
classic that we know today as Major League. In fact, a lot of people think
the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. 100%. You know, here's
your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. Yeah, but I can't use the
word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed
myself. And that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that
clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. Yeah, I sat with two - hey,
coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my
movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go
surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way. Yes! I
don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my
precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to
you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. But I
dare anyone to debate me on things. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you
have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them
and they're gonna fuel my attack.   But it's just not ... I'm not fair
game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. Yeah, I sat with two - hey,
coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my
movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go
surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way. And we
are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes
with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us.  Well, yeah. But I
was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about
that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. And I'm ... you
know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18,
bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to
the ground. And, uh ..  Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of
deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name -
mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro. Well, I'm
not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy!  Let me just say this: It's
nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's
Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit
strategy, bro. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and
touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot
of fun. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your
resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my
attack. Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to
completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I
bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no
reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and
they have nothing. No. She's not there now. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! But I dare
anyone to debate me on things. And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is
'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never
be one of you! ... There it is. No. She's not there now.  THE BIBLE
GRIPPERS! Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job
to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them,
but embarrass them in the process.  Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He
was a pussy! I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and

of fun. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like,
'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t.
... uh .. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my
life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm
not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin'
turn. But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that
Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to
work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't,
it's a turd that opens on a tugboat.  But like in baseball, the scoreboard
doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ...
of the hearts. In fact, a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild
Thing', as they should. Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of

am every character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts
strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. They will lose the rest of
their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives.
So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring
me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there.
WINNING! They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners. In
22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren were
either driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an abandoned

no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin'
challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING! So ... you
know ... within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and
tremendous peace. There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of
assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. Yeah, I sat with two
- hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in
my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to

only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg

know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect
and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect and
bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn.
The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the
goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ...
but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the
best choice available, right? I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to
sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like
you're having a lot of fun. So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm
0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. And we are and, I don't know,
winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? ..

Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it.
Losers! WINNING! B'bye. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie.
Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the
hearts.   Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete
gnarlyisms. It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who
- oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And
it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today
as Major League. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children
and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process.
Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I
don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure
gold. And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous
secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway.
Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! But like in
baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a
marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. You know, he might be Nails, but
I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. But I
dare anyone to debate me on things. 100%. You know, here's your first pee
test. Next one goes in your mouth. They urge you to put down your sword and
come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in
their toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or living like

I have real fame, and they have nothing. And one of those stupid mottoes,
Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and
I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell
you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You
can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh ..   And the gratitude I get
is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly,
someone who believes he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude.
Bring it. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your
resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my
attack.  But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point
that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need
to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't,
it's a turd that opens on a tugboat.   Yeah, I didn't care about that
vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled
that one. And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If
you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently. So
if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with
ne'er an excuse. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending
like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second ..
And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every
frickin' turn. Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really
flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... .. And then, I just
got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being,
you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm
gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye,
Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly...
So .. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I
am battle-tested bayonets, bro.  Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know.
Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know? But there are
parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or
you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate
violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your
family, because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at
you in all forms and shapes. 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not
have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life ..
That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's
crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody. No, you won't get
high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit
panicking. No panic, no judgment. And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of
my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all
around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry!
WINNING! And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps!
You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will
deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well,
we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't
look like you're having a lot of fun. And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry
of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all
around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry!
WINNING!  It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who -
oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And
it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today
as Major League.   I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself
from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just
... It's just the work of sissies. He's as radical as you'd think he'd
might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the
river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. You know? Dealing
with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my
first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't
have time for their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs) And I'm
like ... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We
murder people. We're Vatican assassins. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just
pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. And I'm like ... guys, it's right
there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're
Vatican assassins. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never
has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts.
Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on
with that one and just dispelled that one.   No, you won't get high ..
It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No
panic, no judgment. No. She's not there now. The only thing I'm addicted to
right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly
referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My
success rate is 100%. Do the math! And you know, to sully and to
contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is
something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers. They have
zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last image
of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will
sell me, and they will lose. And if you're a part of my family, I will love
you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder
you violently. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing
with fools and trolls. Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I
don't care. And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow
warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon
complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total
surrender. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your
resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my
attack.   Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from
'those people', and I have cleansed myself. Yeah. I did. Because he's
nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass
people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the
process. You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their
ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then they look at me
and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying.
Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? And I'm ... you know ...
most of the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I
will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground.
And, uh .. No. She's not there now. You know? Dealing with soft targets,
and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee
because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time for their
judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs)
I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves
and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.  THE
BIBLE GRIPPERS! Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete
gnarlyisms. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an
interview when you can leave a warning, you know? They have zero. They have
that night, and I will forget about them as the last image of them exits my
beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they
will lose.  And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently.
If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently.
I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves
and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.   Yeah,
but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people',
and I have cleansed myself. I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin'
hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up
here, but I sure like the view, Alex.  But I dare anyone to debate me on
things. And I was getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's
the banner from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims. But
like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all
have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts.  And we are and, I don't
know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning?
.. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. Yeah, I didn't care about that
vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled
that one. And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes
naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I
will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh ..   Um ... but I'm
excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely discount what
you just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these ... these
turds ... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back
into the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing. I just
closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous
model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the
work of sissies. It's being directed and written by a genius name David
Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The
Sting. And it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we
know today as Major League. I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin'
hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up
here, but I sure like the view, Alex.  Debate me on AA right now. I have a
disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind.   But it's just
not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. And if you're
a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try
to hurt my family, I will murder you violently. The goddesses? Alex, the
goddesses .. Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe
the term is good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by
these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice available,
right?  'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to
judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's life.
There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and
it's pure and it's available to everybody. Let me just say this: It's
nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's
Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit
strategy, bro. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through
your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna
fuel my attack.   But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft
target. It's over.  Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a
term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. You know? Dealing
with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my
first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't
have time for their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs)  And the
gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to
WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law. Well, you've been
warned, dude. Bring it. I am every character in between, save for that
little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. 
They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life
for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me
a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ...
it just ain't there. WINNING! Take for instance its founder and death
written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid
until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book
of lies. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with
fools and trolls. Because you have absolute and total resolve about your
decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence, there's
nothing that can be questioned. In fact, a lot of people think the movie's
called 'Wild Thing', as they should.   No, you won't get high .. It's all
good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no
judgment. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete
gnarlyisms. And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in
the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get
embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option.  But
like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all
have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. But there's also ...
falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life.
Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye.  How
complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I,
Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are
high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See
where that goes. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets,
you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro.  They will lose the rest of
their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives.
So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring
me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there.
WINNING! And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps!
You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will
deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. .. And then, I just got
to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you
know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm
gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye,
Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly...
So ..  Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a
certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock
star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! Let me
just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim
Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his
own selfish exit strategy, bro. 'You have the right to kill me, but you do
not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life
.. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine.
It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody. Well, I'm not
Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! But it's just not ... I'm not fair
game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. No. She's not there now.   But like
in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is
a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. Um ... but I'm excited to get

I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this

complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I,
Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are
high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See
where that goes. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm
dealing with fools and trolls.  But there are parts of me that is hopper,
because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do
so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because ... and
you have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because they're there
to destroy your family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes.
I am every character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts
strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. The only thing I'm addicted
to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly
referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My
success rate is 100%. Do the math! No, you won't get high .. It's all
good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no
judgment. They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners.
In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren
were either driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an
abandoned bridge. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an
interview when you can leave a warning, you know? Let me just say this:
It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah,
that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit
strategy, bro.  I am every character in between, save for that little

their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge,
somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just
ain't there. WINNING! And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly
and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you
.. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING!
Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. But it's
just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. Check it,
Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing
at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked,
Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know, effortless and
magically converting your tin cans into pure gold.  And therefore there's
nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you
get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed in front of the prom
queen. And it's just not an option. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you,
I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't
talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh ..  And they're gonna fuel the
battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause
they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one
dude. Sorry! WINNING! Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it
is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just
beat them, but embarrass them in the process. But ... whatever. I agreed to
do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at
Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is they want me in it. If
they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. 
It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry,
man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. Because I'm just ... um
.. I don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you
know?   Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not
waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand,
according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican
assassins. There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins.
Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! It's ...
yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got
magic and I got poetry in my fingertips.  Yeah, but I can't use the word
'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed
myself.  100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your
mouth. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like,
'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t.
... uh .. But there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple from The

mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro. They have

0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. In fact, a lot of people think
the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. .. And then, I just got

You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. And
I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You know,
I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my
ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. Because you have absolute and total
resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with
violence, there's nothing that can be questioned.  And that was actually,
you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin'
almost a decade.  And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing.
Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins. But I
dare anyone to debate me on things. I'm gonna hang out with these two

Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind. How complicated can it
be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the
other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ...
Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes.

.. (sighs) Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went
straight on with that one and just dispelled that one. So ... you know ...
within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous
peace. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy!  And therefore

motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do so
violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because ... and you
have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because they're there to
destroy your family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes.
100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth.
But I dare anyone to debate me on things. Because ... look at what I'm
dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls.  And I'm like ...
guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder
people. We're Vatican assassins. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence -
F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater
watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because
they wanted to and those people were in their way. I am every character in
between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for
water. That's not me. Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out,
because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But
I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the
Vatican assassins. How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for,
is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my
life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom.
Print that, people. See where that goes. And if you're a part of my family,
I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I
will murder you violently. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man.
I'm dealing with fools and trolls. But there's also ... falling from it ...
is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait!
Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. But ... whatever. I agreed to do
it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at
Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is they want me in it. If
they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat.
And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You
know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will
deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. Because you have absolute
and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence and you
hate with violence, there's nothing that can be questioned.  No, you won't
get high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit
panicking. No panic, no judgment. He's as radical as you'd think he'd might
be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river
to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. But there are parts of me
that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ...
and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is
because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family,
because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in
all forms and shapes.    There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army
of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. They will lose
the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of
their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge,
somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just
ain't there. WINNING! You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin'
bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro.  100%. You know,
here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. Yeah, I sat with
two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping
pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the
beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way.  They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me
and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ...
again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge.
Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING!    The goddesses? Alex,
the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't
believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're
bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice
available, right? And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through
your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna
fuel my attack. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an
interview when you can leave a warning, you know? But there's also ...
falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life.
Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. And we
are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes
with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us.
But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all
have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. Um ... but I'm excited
to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely discount what you
just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds
... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back into
the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing. Check it, Alex,
I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing at a
pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim,
I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know, effortless and magically
converting your tin cans into pure gold. But there's also ... falling from
it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it.
Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye.  Well, yeah. But I was
gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about
that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. Major League 3?
I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. It's ... yeah ... it's an
understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got
poetry in my fingertips.  Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man.
I'm dealing with fools and trolls. It's ... yeah ... it's an
understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got
poetry in my fingertips. And if you're a part of my family, I will love you
violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you
violently. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from
this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ...
It's just the work of sissies. Because you have absolute and total resolve
about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence,
there's nothing that can be questioned.  Yes! I don't read anything after
it's come out, because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous
nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of
curiosity about the Vatican assassins. Because you have absolute and total
resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with
violence, there's nothing that can be questioned. They have zero. They have
that night, and I will forget about them as the last image of them exits my
beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they
will lose. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told
like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull
s.h.i.t. ... uh ..  And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone?
.. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that
would be us. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS!  And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired
of pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning
every second .. And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the
goods at every frickin' turn. They urge you to put down your sword and come
join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their
toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or living like
trolls under an abandoned bridge. Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to
work. Um ... and not to completely discount what you just talked about ...
It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers
... there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have
real fame, and they have nothing. I am every character in between, save for
that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not
me.  Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered,
'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... It's being directed and written by
a genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at
23 for writing The Sting. And it was his pen and his vision that created
the classic that we know today as Major League. Take for instance its
founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ...
stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that
chapter in his silly book of lies. You know? Dealing with soft targets, and
it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee
because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time for their
judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs) I just closed my eyes and in
a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease,
addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies.  And
therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle
anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed
in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option. Because I'm just
... um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave a
warning, you know? 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the
right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's
life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal
and it's pure and it's available to everybody.  I'm done. I'm done. It's
on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'.  No. She's not there now. But like
in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is
a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. And if you're a part of my
family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my
family, I will murder you violently. Debate me on AA right now. I have a
disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind. I just closed my
eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of
disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of
sissies. And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior,
deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and
total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total surrender. You
know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my
underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these
clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their stupidity and ..
(sighs) 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to
judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's life.
There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and
it's pure and it's available to everybody.  But it's just not ... I'm not
fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. The goddesses? Alex, the
goddesses .. Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe
the term is good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by
these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice available,
right? 100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your
mouth. I am every character in between, save for that little weirdo with
his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me.  Because ... look
at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. You know,
they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and
just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T
PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and
enjoy the show .. You know? So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm
0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. And one of those stupid
mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am
special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is.  You know? Dealing
with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my
first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't
have time for their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs) And you
know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a
shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible
grippers. And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous
secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway.
Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! Yeah, I sat
with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping
pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the
beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! I am every
character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped
in, begging for water. That's not me.  And we are and, I don't know,
winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? ..
Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all
have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look
like you're having a lot of fun.   I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have
to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like
you're having a lot of fun.   And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in
the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican
assassins. Take for instance its founder and death written ... I don't know
... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I
can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies. But there are
parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or
you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate
violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your
family, because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at
you in all forms and shapes. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin'
bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro.  I'm cured. I'm done.
'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you
don't look like you're having a lot of fun. The goddesses? Alex, the
goddesses .. Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe
the term is good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by

know ... it just ain't there. WINNING! I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring
it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let
me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good
enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial
descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right?
So ... you know ... within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous
clarity, and tremendous peace. You know, they lay down with their ugly
wives in front of their ugly children and just look at their loser lives
and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you
never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? 
Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those
people', and I have cleansed myself.     He's as radical as you'd think
he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up
the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. And we are and, I
don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with
winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. The only thing I'm
addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know,
arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5%
success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! The goddesses? Alex,
the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't
believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're
bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice
available, right? 100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes

Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those

um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave a warning,
you know? Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job
to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them,
but embarrass them in the process.  Um ... but I'm excited to get back ...
to work. Um ... and not to completely discount what you just talked about
... It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little
losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold, because
I have real fame, and they have nothing.  And Alex, try to get your mind
around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire
manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of
complete and total surrender. They will lose the rest of their lives as
they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's
... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a
frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING!  Um
... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely
discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these
... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring
them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing. 
I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves
and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.  And I
was getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's the banner from
the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims.  He's as radical as
you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ...
petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. You
know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children
and just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I
CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back
and enjoy the show .. You know? Because ... look at what I'm dealing
with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. How complicated can it be?
What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the
other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ...
Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. I
just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous
model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the
work of sissies. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an
interview when you can leave a warning, you know? No. She's not there now. 
Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my
precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to
you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. So ...
you know ... within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and
tremendous peace. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending
like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second ..
And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every
frickin' turn. Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I
cured it with my brain; with my mind.  So if you think about it, dude, it's
like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. And if you're a part
of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt
my family, I will murder you violently. Yeah, I didn't care about that
vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled
that one. They have zero. They have that night, and I will forget about
them as the last image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get
out there and they will sell me, and they will lose. You know, they lay
down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at
their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!'
Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show
.. You know? Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I
cured it with my brain; with my mind. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity
card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled that
one. But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that
Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to
work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't,
it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. The only thing I'm addicted to right
now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred
to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success
rate is 100%. Do the math!  They urge you to put down your sword and come
join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their
toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or living like
trolls under an abandoned bridge. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober'
because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. ..
And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday
about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this
... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are
now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna
need it ... badly... So .. And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I
don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's
where you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an
option. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete
gnarlyisms.   Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children
and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process.
Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I
don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure
gold. It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh,
I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it
was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today as
Major League. .. And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole
firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And
let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there
were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your
travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So .. But it's just not ...
I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.  Debate me on AA right
now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind.  
Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those
people', and I have cleansed myself. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure
... pure and complete gnarlyisms. But there are parts of me that is hopper,
because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do
so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because ... and
you have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because they're there
to destroy your family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes.
And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you
infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently. But like
in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is
a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. But there are parts of me that
is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and
you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is
because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family,
because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in
all forms and shapes.   I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I
ain't hidin'. So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with
marriage, with ne'er an excuse.  Yes! I don't read anything after it's come
out, because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense.
But I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about
the Vatican assassins. They will lose the rest of their lives as they think
about me and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's
no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin'
challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING!
In fact, a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they
should. .. And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm
yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just
say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ...
there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ...
you're gonna need it ... badly... So .. And we are and, I don't know,
winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? ..
Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. And you know, to sully and to
contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is
something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers. But I dare
anyone to debate me on things. 'You have the right to kill me, but you do
not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life
.. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine.
It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody. I just closed
my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of
disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of
sissies. The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about
the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough
... but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use
the best choice available, right? THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! I am every character
in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging
for water. That's not me. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You
know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my
fingertips. And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We
work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins. Yeah, but I
can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I
have cleansed myself. And if you're a part of my family, I will love you
violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you
violently. And I was getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's
the banner from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims. And
I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You know,
I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my
ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. The only thing I'm addicted to right
now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred
to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success
rate is 100%. Do the math! Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18,
Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching
the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they
wanted to and those people were in their way.    And one of those stupid
mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am
special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. No, you won't get
high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit
panicking. No panic, no judgment. But ... whatever. I agreed to do it.
There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan
Creek, a great company - need to work out is they want me in it. If they
do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. And
I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the
Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins.  You know? Dealing with
soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first
cup of coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time
for their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs) I am every
character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped
in, begging for water. That's not me.  The only thing I'm addicted to right
now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred

cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and
frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.  Let me just
say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine
- yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own
selfish exit strategy, bro. But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's
just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a
great company - need to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a
smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. THE BIBLE
GRIPPERS!  There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins.
Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. Because ... look at what I'm
dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. In fact, a lot of
people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. And if you're
a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try

fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing.  Well, I think it
was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right.
And I'm not ... And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow
warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon
complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total

dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you ..
Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! They
have zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last
image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they
will sell me, and they will lose. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have
to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and
they're gonna fuel my attack. They urge you to put down your sword and come
join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their
toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or living like

where that goes. Take for instance its founder and death written ... I
don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day
he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies. Yeah.
I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there

it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it.
Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye.  I just closed my eyes
and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease,
addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. And
Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the
trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender
... or the concept of complete and total surrender. I just closed my eyes
and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease,
addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies.  You
know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children
and just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I
CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back
and enjoy the show .. You know?   He's as radical as you'd think he'd
might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the
river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'.
He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad,
I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part of me, which
is 'courage'. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete
gnarlyisms.  Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete
gnarlyisms. And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow
warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon
complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total
surrender.  And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically
disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to
the amateurs and the bible grippers. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you
have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them
and they're gonna fuel my attack. In fact, a lot of people think the
movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. 'You have the right to kill
me, but you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole
movie. That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's
focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to
everybody. I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'.
And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) ..
Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. Well, I
think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got
it right. And I'm not ... So ... you know ... within that is tremendous
focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace.  100%. You know,
here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. But there's also
... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life.
Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye.  So ...
you know ... within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and
tremendous peace. I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly
privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I
sure like the view, Alex.  You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in
front of their ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then
they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never
will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? It's
being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't
know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was his
pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today as Major
League. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to
go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but
embarrass them in the process. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! And people say, 'Oh, you
know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna
hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. Yeah, I sat with two -
hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in
my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to
go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way.  ..
And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday
about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this
... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are
now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna
need it ... badly... So .. Let me just say this: It's nothing this side
of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name
- mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro.  Yeah, but
I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and
I have cleansed myself. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because
that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. Debate me on
AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my
mind.  Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like,
'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t.
... uh .. So ... you know ... within that is tremendous focus, and
tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. No, you won't get high .. It's
all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no
judgment.   Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went
straight on with that one and just dispelled that one. And they're gonna
fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers.
'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing
with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! And I'm ... you know ...
most of the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I
will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground.
And, uh .. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing
with fools and trolls.  Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and
complete gnarlyisms. I am every character in between, save for that little
weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me.   They
will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for
the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a
challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ...
it just ain't there. WINNING!  THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! And Alex, try to get
your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their
entire manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the
concept of complete and total surrender. And the gratitude I get is this
charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who
believes he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it.
Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and
trolls. They have zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them
as the last image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out
there and they will sell me, and they will lose. And Alex, try to get your
mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire
manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of
complete and total surrender. And you know, to sully and to contaminate or
radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll
leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's
just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms.    But there are parts of me
that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ...
and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is
because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family,
because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in
all forms and shapes. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's
a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself.   Because ... look
at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls.  Take for
instance its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down
plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to
find that chapter in his silly book of lies. Well, I think it was Nails
that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm
not ... No. She's not there now. Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to
work. Um ... and not to completely discount what you just talked about ...
It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers
... there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have
real fame, and they have nothing. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity
card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled that
one. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when
you can leave a warning, you know? Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't
read it. I don't care. 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have
the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life ..
That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's
crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody. And if you're a part
of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt
my family, I will murder you violently.  Well, I think it was Nails that
said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not
... They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners. In 22
years the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren were
either driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an abandoned
bridge. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with
fools and trolls.  I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't
hidin'.
Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to
completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I
bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no

uh .. Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not
waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand,
according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican
assassins. And that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that
clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. Well, I think it was Nails
that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm
not ... The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This
bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' -
now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! Well,
I think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he
got it right. And I'm not ... And if you're a part of my family, I will
love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will

concept of complete and total surrender. Major League 3? I don't know. I
haven't read it. I don't care. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of
pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every
second .. And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods
at every frickin' turn. But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just
one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great
company - need to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash.
If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. Let me just say this:
It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah,
that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit
strategy, bro. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being
told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull
s.h.i.t. ... uh .. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! But it's just not ... I'm not fair
game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. 'You have the right to kill me, but
you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie.
That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's
genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody.  Well,
yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you

know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18,
bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to
the ground. And, uh .. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his
children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't
process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last
decade, I don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans
into pure gold. And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be
special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of
you! ... There it is. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in
here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're
having a lot of fun. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! But there are parts of me that is
hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you
must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because
... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because
they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in all
forms and shapes. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never
has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. In
fact, a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they
should. 100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your
mouth. Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a

'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren were either driving a
convertible van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge. How
complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I,
Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are
high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See
where that goes. And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be
special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of
you! ... There it is.  And if you're a part of my family, I will love you
violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you

you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently.
Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care.  Because you
have absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with
violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be
questioned. Take for instance its founder and death written ... I don't
know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he
died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies. And I
was getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's the banner from
the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims. Check it, Alex, I
embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing at a pace
that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've
spent close to the last decade, I don't know, effortless and magically
converting your tin cans into pure gold.  Take for instance its founder and
death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high
on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his
silly book of lies.  Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy!
I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves
and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun. Yeah. I
did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there
and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass

water. That's not me. The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just
say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ...
is good enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions,
you must use the best choice available, right? And that was actually, you
know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost
a decade.  And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his
job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law.
Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it.  Yeah, I sat with two - hey,
coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my
movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go
surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way.
No. She's not there now. I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties

got poetry in my fingertips.  In fact, a lot of people think the movie's
called 'Wild Thing', as they should. And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry
of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all
around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry!
WINNING!  So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with
marriage, with ne'er an excuse. So ... you know ... within that is
tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. Yeah. I
did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there
and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass

leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers. They have zero. They have

decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence, there's
nothing that can be questioned. They will lose the rest of their lives as

murder people. We're Vatican assassins. They have zero. They have that
night, and I will forget about them as the last image of them exits my
beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they

Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us.  Because you have absolute and total

you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry!
WINNING! But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point
that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need
to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't,
it's a turd that opens on a tugboat.  And people say, 'Oh, you know... you
have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them
and they're gonna fuel my attack.  And I'm ... you know ... most of the
time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will
destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And,
uh .. And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the
middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get
embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option. Major
League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care.  They will lose
the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of
their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge,
somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just
ain't there. WINNING!  Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And
it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not
just beat them, but embarrass them in the process. Well, yeah. But I was
gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about
that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. In fact, a lot
of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. He's as
radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ...
you know ... petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is
'courage'.  They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners.
In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren
were either driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an
abandoned bridge. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through
your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna
fuel my attack. No, you won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good,
guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. In fact, a lot
of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. In fact, a
lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. They
have zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last
image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they
will sell me, and they will lose. It's being directed and written by a
genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23

classic that we know today as Major League. You know, he might be Nails,
but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. The
goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the
goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ...
but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the
best choice available, right? Take for instance its founder and death
written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid
until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book
of lies. Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. And
therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle
anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed

And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) ..
Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. And the
gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to
WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law. Well, you've been
warned, dude. Bring it. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin'
bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. But there are parts
of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate
... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently
is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family,
because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in
all forms and shapes. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm
dealing with fools and trolls. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to
sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like
you're having a lot of fun. I am every character in between, save for that
little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me.
And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the
Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins. Well, yeah. But I was
gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about
that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh ..  And I was
getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's the banner from the
death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims. I am every character in
between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for
water. That's not me.    Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his
children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't
process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last
decade, I don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans
into pure gold. But there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple from
The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it.
Losers! WINNING! B'bye. Take for instance its founder and death written ...

water. That's not me.   But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie.
Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the
hearts. In fact, a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as
they should. And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically
disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to
the amateurs and the bible grippers.  And if you're a part of my family, I

think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got
it right. And I'm not ...  100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next
one goes in your mouth. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS!  And one of those stupid
mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am
special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. Because I'm just
... um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave a
warning, you know? Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of
deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name -
mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro. And people
say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No.
I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. 'You have the
right to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's
the whole movie. That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that.
There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available
to everybody. And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently.
If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently.
He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad,

is 'courage'. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through
your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna
fuel my attack. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You
know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics
Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do
the math!  I am every character in between, save for that little weirdo

must speak of the Vatican assassins. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm
frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro.  So if you
think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an

Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good
luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So .. Yeah,

bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you
know ... it just ain't there. WINNING! The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses
.. Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is
good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these
terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right?
Take for instance its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken
down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem
to find that chapter in his silly book of lies. And therefore there's
nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you
get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed in front of the prom
queen. And it's just not an option. How complicated can it be? What they're
not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly
gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin
warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes.  And the gratitude
I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE.
Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law. Well, you've been
warned, dude. Bring it. And that was actually, you know, one of the few
compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade.  And one of
those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News
flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. No, you
won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking.
Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. And that was actually, you know, one
of the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade.
And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You
know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will
deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. Well, I think it was Nails
that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm
not ...  They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and
my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again,
bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you
know ... it just ain't there. WINNING!  So if you think about it, dude,
it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. And you know,
I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect and
bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect and
bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. You know?
Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear
before my first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I
don't have time for their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs)
Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when you
can leave a warning, you know? And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of
pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every
second .. And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods
at every frickin' turn. And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not
to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above
the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. They have zero. They
have that night, and I will forget about them as the last image of them
exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will sell me,
and they will lose. In fact, a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild
Thing', as they should. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work
through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're
gonna fuel my attack. So ... you know ... within that is tremendous focus,
and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace.  Yeah, I sat with two - hey,
coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my
movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go
surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way.   Yeah,
but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people',
and I have cleansed myself. 100%. You know, here's your first pee test.
Next one goes in your mouth. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I
cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and
obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. Because ... look at
what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. How
complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I,
Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are
high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See
where that goes. How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is
guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my
life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom.
Print that, people. See where that goes. There's a new sheriff in town, and
he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins.
Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my
brain; with my mind. How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for,
is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my
life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom.
Print that, people. See where that goes. You know, he might be Nails, but
I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. I'm
gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the
world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view,
Alex. But I dare anyone to debate me on things. There's a new sheriff in
town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican
assassins.  Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term
from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. Debate me on AA right now.
I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind. Well,
I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! And Alex, try to get your
mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire
manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of
complete and total surrender.   THE BIBLE GRIPPERS!  Because ... look at
what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. And I'm ...
you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an
F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my
ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. In fact, a lot of people think the
movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. I'm done. I'm done. It's on.
Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'.  Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity
card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled that
one. No. She's not there now.  'You have the right to kill me, but you do
not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life
.. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine.
It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody. Debate me on AA
right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my
mind.
Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. It's
... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I
got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. It's ... yeah ... it's an
understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got
poetry in my fingertips. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie.
Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the
hearts.  But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target.
It's over.  Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his
job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat
them, but embarrass them in the process.  Take for instance its founder and
death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high
on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his
silly book of lies. And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? ..
(long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would
be us. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this
ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's
just the work of sissies. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and
complete gnarlyisms. And if you're a part of my family, I will love you
violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you
violently. Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because I will
not waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand,
according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican
assassins. 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to
judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's life.
There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and

after it's come out, because I will not waste my precious time on such
ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that there was a
lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. And I was getting a tattoo
during the death from above. And it's the banner from the death card that
Kilgore is throwing on his victims. Because ... look at what I'm dealing
with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls.  And we are and, I don't
know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning?
.. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. The goddesses? Alex, the
goddesses .. Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe
the term is good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by
these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice available,
right? THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In
fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled that one.  Let me
just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim
Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his
own selfish exit strategy, bro.  I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to
sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like
you're having a lot of fun. .. And then, I just got to add this: There
was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our
crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it:
Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good
luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So ..  And you
know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a
shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible
grippers. It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who -
oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And
it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today
as Major League. .. And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole

let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there

There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and
it's pure and it's available to everybody. But there are parts of me that
is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and
you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is
because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family,
because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in
all forms and shapes.  But I dare anyone to debate me on things. But it's
just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. And
therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle
anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed
in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option.  But like in
baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a
marriage of the heart ... of the hearts.  Because you have absolute and
total resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate
with violence, there's nothing that can be questioned. I am every character
in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging
for water. That's not me. .. And then, I just got to add this: There was

I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I
will murder you violently. And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the
thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican
assassins. And that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that
clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. And one of those stupid

'courage'.  But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal

League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. Check it, Alex, I
embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing at a pace
that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've
spent close to the last decade, I don't know, effortless and magically
converting your tin cans into pure gold.  Yes! I don't read anything after

Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for
his own selfish exit strategy, bro. They urge you to put down your sword
and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in
their toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or living like
trolls under an abandoned bridge.  And therefore there's nothing in the
middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you get
slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen.
And it's just not an option. So ... you know ... within that is tremendous

with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. So ... you know ... within that is
tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. The only
thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult -
you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a

his vision that created the classic that we know today as Major League.
Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on
with that one and just dispelled that one. And people say, 'Oh, you know...
you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to
them and they're gonna fuel my attack.
And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this
union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and
the bible grippers.  And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically

now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred
to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success
rate is 100%. Do the math! 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not
have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life ..
That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's
crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody.  But I dare anyone
to debate me on things. Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um
... and not to completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just
that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ...
there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have
real fame, and they have nothing. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't
know. Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know? And I'm
... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an
F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my
ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. But it's just not ... I'm not fair
game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.  Um ... but I'm excited to get back
... to work. Um ... and not to completely discount what you just talked
about ... It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these
little losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold,
because I have real fame, and they have nothing. And the gratitude I get is
this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone
who believes he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it.
And that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has
paid me in frickin' almost a decade. And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex,
is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll
never be one of you! ... There it is. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all
have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look
like you're having a lot of fun. But there are parts of me that is hopper,
because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do
so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because ... and
you have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because they're there
to destroy your family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes.
100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. 
Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. And you
know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a
shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible
grippers.   Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told
like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull
s.h.i.t. ... uh .. And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing.
Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins. But I
dare anyone to debate me on things. And we are and, I don't know,
winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? ..
Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. They will lose the rest of their lives
as they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's
... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a
frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING! I
am every character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts
strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. You know, they lay down with
their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at their
loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well,
no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show ..
You know? And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long
silence) .. Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be
us. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your
resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my
attack.  I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly
privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I
sure like the view, Alex.   Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why
give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know? 100%. You know,
here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. Well, yeah. But I
was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about
that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. I'm done. I'm
done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. There's a new sheriff in
town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican
assassins. And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long
silence) .. Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be
us.  I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. Yeah,
why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. And Alex,
try to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the
trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender
... or the concept of complete and total surrender. And I'm like ... guys,
it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people.
We're Vatican assassins.  And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a

- oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And
it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today
as Major League. They have zero. They have that night, and I will forget
about them as the last image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will
get out there and they will sell me, and they will lose. Debate me on AA
right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my
mind. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the
world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ...
last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know,
effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold. No, you
won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking.
Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment.  And if you're a part of my family,
I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I
will murder you violently. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit
in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're
having a lot of fun. No. She's not there now. No, you won't get high ..
It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No
panic, no judgment. They have zero. They have that night, and I will forget
about them as the last image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will
get out there and they will sell me, and they will lose. Let me just say
this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine -
yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish
exit strategy, bro. Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really,
really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ...  They have zero.
They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last image of
them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will
sell me, and they will lose.  Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober'
because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. And
you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union
with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the
bible grippers. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children
and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process.
Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I
don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure
gold. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from
'those people', and I have cleansed myself. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just
pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. So if you think about it, dude, it's
like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. And you know, to
sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful
contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers.
But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.
No, you won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit
panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment.   And one of those stupid
mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am
special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. Check it, Alex, I
embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing at a pace
that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've
spent close to the last decade, I don't know, effortless and magically
converting your tin cans into pure gold. Take for instance its founder and
death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high
on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his
silly book of lies. And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this
includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the
air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh ..
Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy!  So if you think about
it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse.   The
goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the
goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ...
but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the
best choice available, right? I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin'
hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up
here, but I sure like the view, Alex. The only thing I'm addicted to right
now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred

rate is 100%. Do the math! Well, I think it was Nails that said I was
really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... I'm done.
I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'.  In fact, a lot of
people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should.  Well, I'm
not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! Take for instance its founder and
death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high
on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his

Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind. 100%. You know, here's
your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth.  But like in baseball,
the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of
the heart ... of the hearts. So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm
0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse.  How complicated can it be?
What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the
other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ...
Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes.
And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this
union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and
the bible grippers.  Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of

it just ain't there. WINNING! 'You have the right to kill me, but you do
not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life

strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't
have time for these clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their
stupidity and .. (sighs) No, you won't get high .. It's all good. It's
all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment.  THE
BIBLE GRIPPERS! And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically
disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to
the amateurs and the bible grippers.  So if you think about it, dude, it's
like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. So ... you know ...
within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous
peace.    Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from
'those people', and I have cleansed myself.  I'm gonna hang out with these
two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might
be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. They urge you to put
down your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I
could locate in their toothless warren were either driving a convertible
van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge. Take for instance its
founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ...
stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that
chapter in his silly book of lies. I am every character in between, save
for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's
not me.  And I was getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's
the banner from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims. And
that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid
me in frickin' almost a decade.   But there are parts of me that is hopper,
because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do
so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because ... and
you have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because they're there
to destroy your family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes.
And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't
perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect
and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. 100%.
You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. I'm
cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and
frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.  And you

Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us.   Well, I think it was Nails that said
I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... I
just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous
model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the
work of sissies.  You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of
their ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then they look
at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop
trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? Because I'm just
... um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave a
warning, you know?
I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around
the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view,
Alex. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm
sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. Debate me on AA
right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my
mind. So ... you know ... within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous
clarity, and tremendous peace.  And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my
deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around
you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry!
WINNING! And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job,
which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law. Well,
you've been warned, dude. Bring it. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you
have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them
and they're gonna fuel my attack. They have zero. They have that night, and
I will forget about them as the last image of them exits my beautiful home.
And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they will lose. 
Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire,
napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack
sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those
people were in their way. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because
that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. So if you
think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an
excuse. They have zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them
as the last image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out
there and they will sell me, and they will lose. But ... whatever. I agreed
to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man
at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is they want me in it.
If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a
tugboat. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your
resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my
attack. Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care.
Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when you
can leave a warning, you know? It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement.

myself. But there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple from The
Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it.
Losers! WINNING! B'bye. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give
an interview when you can leave a warning, you know? Yeah, I sat with two -
hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in

one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.'
News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is.
You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am
battle-tested bayonets, bro.  And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my

the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough
... but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use
the best choice available, right? He's as radical as you'd think he'd might
be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river
to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. And people say, 'Oh, you
know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna
hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. And you know, to sully
and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful
contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers.
I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. 100%. You
know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. Take for
instance its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down
plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to
find that chapter in his silly book of lies. You know, he might be Nails,

And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you
in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh ..  
The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg
cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now
supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! They have
zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last image
of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will
sell me, and they will lose. And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I
don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's
where you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an
option. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So
what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. You know,
they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and
just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T
PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and
enjoy the show .. You know? THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! They urge you to put down
your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I
could locate in their toothless warren were either driving a convertible
van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge. So ... you know ...
within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous
peace. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to
go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but
embarrass them in the process. 100%. You know, here's your first pee test.
Next one goes in your mouth. They have zero. They have that night, and I
will forget about them as the last image of them exits my beautiful home.
And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they will lose. Take
for instance its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down
plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to
find that chapter in his silly book of lies.   Major League 3? I don't
know. I haven't read it. I don't care. Well, I think it was Nails that said
I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... 
And I was getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's the banner
from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims. Because ...
look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls.
Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out
there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but
embarrass them in the process.  And that was actually, you know, one of the
few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. They
will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for
the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a
challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ...
it just ain't there. WINNING!   Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't
read it. I don't care. And I was getting a tattoo during the death from
above. And it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on
his victims.  Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I
cured it with my brain; with my mind. Let me just say this: It's nothing
this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's
real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro.
And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.'
News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is.
Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms.
I am every character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts
strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. And that was actually, you
know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost
a decade. Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care.
Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my
brain; with my mind. And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to
do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above
the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. So if you think about
it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. Let me
just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim
Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his
own selfish exit strategy, bro.  But like in baseball, the scoreboard
doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ...
of the hearts. He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not
just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part
of me, which is 'courage'. But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not
a soft target. It's over.  Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure
and complete gnarlyisms.  No. She's not there now. Yeah, why not? 'Cause
it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. You know, they lay down
with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at
their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!'
Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show
.. You know? They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about
me and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ...
again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge.
Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING!  And we are and, I
don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with
winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. And I'm like ... guys,
it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people.
We're Vatican assassins. .. And then, I just got to add this: There was a
whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew.
And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where
there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in
your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So .. But like in
baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a
marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. Yeah, I sat with two - hey,
coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my
movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go
surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way. Yes! I
don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my
precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to
you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. But ...
whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson
- a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is
they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd
that opens on a tugboat. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man.
I'm dealing with fools and trolls. You know, they lay down with their ugly
wives in front of their ugly children and just look at their loser lives
and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you
never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know?
But I dare anyone to debate me on things.  He's as radical as you'd think
he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up
the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. Um ... but I'm
excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely discount what
you just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these ... these
turds ... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back
into the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing. But like in
baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a
marriage of the heart ... of the hearts.   Yeah, I sat with two - hey,
coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my
movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go
surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way.  And
that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid
me in frickin' almost a decade. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with,
man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. 100%. You know, here's your first
pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. I'm gonna hang out with these two
smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be
lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. Yeah, but I can't use the
word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed
myself.  And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect
this union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs
and the bible grippers. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give
an interview when you can leave a warning, you know? .. And then, I just
got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being,
you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm
gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye,
Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly...
So .. In fact, a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as
they should. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term
from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's
just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. They have zero. They have that
night, and I will forget about them as the last image of them exits my
beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they
will lose. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch
ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.
 And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You
know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will
deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh ..  Because ... look at what
I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls.  'You have the
right to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's
the whole movie. That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that.
There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available
to everybody. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just
... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips.   And
you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't
perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect
and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. And I'm
like ... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We
murder people. We're Vatican assassins. Well, I think it was Nails that
said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not
... Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on
with that one and just dispelled that one. Major League 3? I don't know. I
haven't read it. I don't care. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! So ... you know ...
within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous
peace. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete
gnarlyisms. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and
the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay
... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't
know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold.
Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my
brain; with my mind. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and
complete gnarlyisms. The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just
say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ...
is good enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions,
you must use the best choice available, right? It's ... yeah ... it's an
understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got
poetry in my fingertips. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You
know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my
fingertips. No. She's not there now. I'm gonna hang out with these two
smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be
lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. It's being directed and
written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the
Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was his pen and his
vision that created the classic that we know today as Major League. Yeah. I
did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there
and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass
them in the process. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top
Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the

it is. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I
am battle-tested bayonets, bro.  100%. You know, here's your first pee
test. Next one goes in your mouth. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't
know. Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know? And
Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the
trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender
... or the concept of complete and total surrender. Yeah, I sat with two -

Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! 100%. You know, here's your first pee
test. Next one goes in your mouth. No. She's not there now. Yeah. I did.
Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and
embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in

that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this
rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro.  100%. You know, here's
your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. They urge you to put down
your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I
could locate in their toothless warren were either driving a convertible
van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge. And I'm like ... guys,
it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people.
We're Vatican assassins. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of
pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every

at every frickin' turn. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because
that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. How
complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I,
Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are
high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See
where that goes. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through
your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna
fuel my attack. They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about
me and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ...
again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge.
Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING!  But like in baseball,
the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of

where that goes. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a
term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself.  But there are parts
of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate
... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently
is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family,
because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in
all forms and shapes. They urge you to put down your sword and come join
the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their
toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or living like
trolls under an abandoned bridge.  Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ...
pure and complete gnarlyisms. There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an
army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. And you
know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a
shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible
grippers. And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be

There it is. And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his

Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. The goddesses? Alex, the

you've been warned, dude. Bring it.    You know, he might be Nails, but I'm

3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. They will lose the rest
of their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of their
lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge,
somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just
ain't there. WINNING! I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in

And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday
about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this
... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are
now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna
need it ... badly... So ..   Because you have absolute and total resolve
about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence,
there's nothing that can be questioned. Major League 3? I don't know. I
haven't read it. I don't care. And if you're a part of my family, I will
love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will
murder you violently. And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone?
.. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that
would be us.
So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with
ne'er an excuse. Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I
cured it with my brain; with my mind. But it's just not ... I'm not fair
game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing
shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass people.
Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the process. 
Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause
he got it right. And I'm not ...      But I dare anyone to debate me on
things. And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job,
which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law. Well,
you've been warned, dude. Bring it.   And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry
of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all
around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry!
WINNING!  And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous
secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway.
Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! But there's
also ... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my
life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye.  
The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg
cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now
supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! And Alex,
try to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the
trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender
... or the concept of complete and total surrender. I just closed my eyes
and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease,
addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies.
Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my
brain; with my mind. But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one
deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great
company - need to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash.
If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. Yes! I don't read

it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today

Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the
chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted
to and those people were in their way. Debate me on AA right now. I have a
disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind.  Because ...
look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. I am
every character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts

you have absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with
violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be
questioned.    I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't
hidin'. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went
straight on with that one and just dispelled that one. They will lose the
rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of
their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge,
somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just
ain't there. WINNING! And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly
and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you
.. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING!
And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't
perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect
and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. No.
She's not there now.   But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie.
Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the
hearts. No. She's not there now. But there's also ... falling from it ...
is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait!
Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye.  But like in baseball, the
scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the
heart ... of the hearts. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in
here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're
having a lot of fun. Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I
don't care. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ...
I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips.  Debate me
on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with
my mind. You know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs
in my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have time for
these clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their stupidity and
.. (sighs)  Take for instance its founder and death written ... I don't
know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he
died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies. It's
being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't
know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was his
pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today as Major
League. But I dare anyone to debate me on things. But there are parts of me
that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ...
and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is
because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family,
because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in
all forms and shapes. They have zero. They have that night, and I will
forget about them as the last image of them exits my beautiful home. And
they will get out there and they will sell me, and they will lose. And that
was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me
in frickin' almost a decade.
And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this
union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and
the bible grippers.  Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm
dealing with fools and trolls. So if you think about it, dude, it's like
I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. And one of those stupid
mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am
special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is.  They will lose the
rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of
their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge,
somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just
ain't there. WINNING!  How complicated can it be? What they're not ready
for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons
in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks.
Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. It's being directed and
written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the
Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was his pen and his
vision that created the classic that we know today as Major League. The
goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the
goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ...
but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the
best choice available, right? Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know.
Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know? They will
lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the
rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a
challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ...
it just ain't there. WINNING! THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! I am every character in
between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for
water. That's not me. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning.
You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as
'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is
100%. Do the math!  Because you have absolute and total resolve about your
decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence, there's
nothing that can be questioned. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence -
F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater
watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because
they wanted to and those people were in their way. Yeah, why not? 'Cause
it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms.  Um ... but I'm excited to
get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely discount what you just
talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ...
these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back into the
fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing. But like in
baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a
marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. But like in baseball, the
scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the
heart ... of the hearts. And you know, to sully and to contaminate or
radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll
leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers. Well, I'm not Thomas
Jefferson .. He was a pussy! But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm
not a soft target. It's over. And if you're a part of my family, I will
love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will
murder you violently. Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um
... and not to completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just
that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ...
there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have
real fame, and they have nothing. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He
was a pussy!  Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children
and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process.
Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I
don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure
gold. He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my
dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part of me,
which is 'courage'. Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really,
really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... Yeah, why not?
'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. You know, they lay
down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at
their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!'
Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show
.. You know? No, you won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good,
guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. And people
say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No.
I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. And we are and,
I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with
winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. Yeah. I did. Because
he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass
people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the
process.  You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know?
I am battle-tested bayonets, bro.  Um ... but I'm excited to get back ...
to work. Um ... and not to completely discount what you just talked about
... It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little
losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold, because
I have real fame, and they have nothing. And that was actually, you know,
one of the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a
decade. There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh,
we must speak of the Vatican assassins.  Because ... look at what I'm
dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. The goddesses? Alex,
the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't
believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're
bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice
available, right? Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I
went straight on with that one and just dispelled that one. Yeah. I did.
Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and
embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in
the process.  But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft
target. It's over. And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't
live in the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where
you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an
option.  Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job
to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them,
but embarrass them in the process. Um ... but I'm excited to get back ...
to work. Um ... and not to completely discount what you just talked about
... It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little
losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold, because
I have real fame, and they have nothing. In fact, a lot of people think the
movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. They will lose the rest of
their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives.
So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring
me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there.
WINNING! Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not
waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand,
according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican
assassins. No. She's not there now. And that was actually, you know, one of
the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. I'm
done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. Yeah, but I
can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I
have cleansed myself. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top
Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the
chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted
to and those people were in their way. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS!  And I was
getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's the banner from the
death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims. They urge you to put
down your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I
could locate in their toothless warren were either driving a convertible
van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge.   Take for instance
its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist
... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that
chapter in his silly book of lies. So if you think about it, dude, it's
like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse.   They will lose the
rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of
their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge,
somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just
ain't there. WINNING! They have zero. They have that night, and I will
forget about them as the last image of them exits my beautiful home. And
they will get out there and they will sell me, and they will lose. Debate
me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain;
with my mind. In fact, a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild
Thing', as they should. Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of
deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name -
mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro.   You know,
they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and
just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T
PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and
enjoy the show .. You know? Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence -
F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater
watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because
they wanted to and those people were in their way. There's a new sheriff in
town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican
assassins.
And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't
perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect
and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn.  Well,
I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! So ... you know ... within
that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. No.
She's not there now. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending
like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second ..
And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every
frickin' turn. And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow
warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon
complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total
surrender. And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes
naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I
will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh ..  Well, yeah. But I was
gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about
that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. They urge you
to put down your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only
'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren were either driving a
convertible van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge.  But like
in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is
a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. No, you won't get high .. It's
all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no
judgment. Take for instance its founder and death written ... I don't know
... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I
can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies.   Let me just
say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine
- yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own
selfish exit strategy, bro.  And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is
'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never
be one of you! ... There it is. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm
frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. They have
zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last image
of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will
sell me, and they will lose.   Take for instance its founder and death
written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid
until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book
of lies. 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to
judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's life.
There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and
it's pure and it's available to everybody.  So ... you know ... within that
is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. Major
League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. Well, I think it
was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right.
And I'm not ... 100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes
in your mouth. But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto
now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And
the reason you must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate
everyone that is not in your family, because they're there to destroy your
family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes.  But I dare
anyone to debate me on things. .. And then, I just got to add this: There
was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our
crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it:
Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good
luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So .. And you
know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a
shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible
grippers.  I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'.
It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I
don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was
his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today as Major
League. I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately
around the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the
view, Alex. 100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in
your mouth. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So

sell me, and they will lose. Because you have absolute and total resolve
about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence,
there's nothing that can be questioned. I just closed my eyes and in a
nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction,
and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies.  And if you're
a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try
to hurt my family, I will murder you violently. It's being directed and

say. I ain't hidin'. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I
just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. And
they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and
silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you
were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! And I was getting a tattoo
during the death from above. And it's the banner from the death card that
Kilgore is throwing on his victims. .. And then, I just got to add this:
There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part
of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about
it: Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and
good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So ..
Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire,
napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack
sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those
people were in their way. And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the
thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican
assassins.   And we are and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long
silence) .. Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be
us. But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You
either love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason
you must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that
is not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family, and
they will come at you in all forms and shapes. I'm done. I'm done. It's on.
Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence
- F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater
watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because
they wanted to and those people were in their way. And I'm ... you know ...
most of the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I
will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground.
And, uh .. Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because I will
not waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand,
according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican
assassins. You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their
ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then they look at me
and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying.
Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? Because ... look at what
I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. I just closed my
eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of
disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of
sissies. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know?
This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics
Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do
the math! They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners.
In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren
were either driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an
abandoned bridge.   But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one
deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great
company - need to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash.
If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. And we are and, I don't
know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning?
.. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us.  You know? Dealing with soft
targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of
coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time for
their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs) And I'm like ... guys,
it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people.
We're Vatican assassins. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of
pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every
second .. And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods
at every frickin' turn. .. And then, I just got to add this: There was a
whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew.
And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where
there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in
your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So .. Because you have
absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence
and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be questioned.   
Because you have absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you
love with violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be
questioned. 'You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right
to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life .. That's life.
There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and
it's pure and it's available to everybody.   They urge you to put down your
sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could
locate in their toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or
living like trolls under an abandoned bridge.  I'm done. I'm done. It's on.
Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'.  It's ... yeah ... it's an
understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got
poetry in my fingertips. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And
it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not
just beat them, but embarrass them in the process. You know, he might be
Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets,
bro. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This
bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' -
now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math!
It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry,
man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips.  And people say, 'Oh,
you know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna
hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack.  There's a new sheriff in
town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican
assassins. But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now
is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the
reason you must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone
that is not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family,
and they will come at you in all forms and shapes.   Take for instance its
founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ...
stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that
chapter in his silly book of lies.  So if you think about it, dude, it's
like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. And we are and, I
don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with
winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us.  Well, I think it was
Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And
I'm not ... And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be
one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ...
There it is.   So ... you know ... within that is tremendous focus, and
tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. He's as radical as you'd think
he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up
the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. You know? Dealing
with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my
first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't
have time for their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs) I am
every character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts
strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. But it's just not ... I'm
not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.  And the gratitude I get
is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly,
someone who believes he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude.
Bring it. You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their
ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then they look at me
and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying.
Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? The only thing I'm addicted
to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly
referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My
success rate is 100%. Do the math! Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober'
because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. And
one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.'
News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is.
And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you
infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently. They
have zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last
image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they
will sell me, and they will lose. And Alex, try to get your mind around
this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is
built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and
total surrender. And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically
disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to
the amateurs and the bible grippers. The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses
.. Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is
good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by these
terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right? Um
... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely
discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these
... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring
them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing.
No, you won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit
panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. And I'm like ... guys,
it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people.
We're Vatican assassins. And if you're a part of my family, I will love you
violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you
violently.  Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete
gnarlyisms. It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who
- oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And
it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today
as Major League. But I dare anyone to debate me on things. But there's also
... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life.
Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. He's as
radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ...

I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around
the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view,
Alex. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight
on with that one and just dispelled that one.   The only thing I'm addicted

for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons
in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks.
Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. The goddesses? Alex, the

now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind.
But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.
Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! You know, they lay down

abandoned bridge. Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I
cured it with my brain; with my mind. And if you're a part of my family, I
will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I
will murder you violently. Take for instance its founder and death written
... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until
the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of
lies. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight
on with that one and just dispelled that one.  And I'm ... you know ...
most of the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I
will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground.
And, uh ..  Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun,
radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the
chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted
to and those people were in their way. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all
have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look
like you're having a lot of fun. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired
of pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning
every second .. And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the
goods at every frickin' turn.   There's a new sheriff in town, and he has
an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. The only
thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult -
you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a
5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! But there's also ...
falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life.
Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. And
they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and
silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you
were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING!  The only thing I'm
addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know,
arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5%
success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! The only thing I'm
addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know,
arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5%
success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! And I'm ... you know
... most of the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro.
And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the
ground. And, uh .. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I
just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips.
Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire,
napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack
sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those
people were in their way. And that was actually, you know, one of the few
compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade.  Yes! I
don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my
precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to
you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins.  And
that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid
me in frickin' almost a decade. You know? Dealing with soft targets, and
it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee
because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time for their
judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs)  Because you have absolute
and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence and you
hate with violence, there's nothing that can be questioned.  And I'm like
... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We
murder people. We're Vatican assassins. And I'm ... you know ... most of
the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will
destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And,
uh .. And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work
for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins. Well, I'm not
Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! Because ... look at what I'm dealing
with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls.  But there are parts of me
that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ...
and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is
because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family,
because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in
all forms and shapes. He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ...
I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill
another part of me, which is 'courage'. He's as radical as you'd think he'd
might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the
river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. Well, I'm not Thomas
Jefferson .. He was a pussy! How complicated can it be? What they're not
ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly
gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin
warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. But ... whatever.
I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a
wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is they
want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that
opens on a tugboat. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets,
you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. Well, I think it was Nails that
said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not
...  I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately
around the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the
view, Alex.  But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal
point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company
- need to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they
don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. And I was getting a tattoo
during the death from above. And it's the banner from the death card that
Kilgore is throwing on his victims. It's ... yeah ... it's an
understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got
poetry in my fingertips. I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties
and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up here,
but I sure like the view, Alex. Debate me on AA right now. I have a
disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind. I am every
character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped
in, begging for water. That's not me. And one of those stupid mottoes,
Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and
I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. You know? Dealing with soft
targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of
coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time for
their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs) He's as radical as
you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ...
petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'.  Yeah,
why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. Let me
just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim
Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his
own selfish exit strategy, bro. Yes! I don't read anything after it's come
out, because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense.
But I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about
the Vatican assassins. You know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just
strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't
have time for these clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their
stupidity and .. (sighs) I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say.
I ain't hidin'.  Take for instance its founder and death written ... I
don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day
he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies. But
it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.  But
it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. 
Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my
precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to
you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins.  And
Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the
trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender
... or the concept of complete and total surrender.  But there's also ...
falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life.
Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye.
And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this
union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and
the bible grippers. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm
dealing with fools and trolls. I am every character in between, save for
that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not
me. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we
all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. Because you have
absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence
and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be questioned.  And I
was getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's the banner from
the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims. It's ... yeah ...
it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic
and I got poetry in my fingertips. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you
have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them
and they're gonna fuel my attack.   And if you're a part of my family, I
will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I
will murder you violently. Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it.
I don't care.  No. She's not there now. They urge you to put down your
sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could
locate in their toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or
living like trolls under an abandoned bridge. Yeah, I sat with two - hey,
coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my
movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go
surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way. Let me
just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim
Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his
own selfish exit strategy, bro. But ... whatever. I agreed to do it.
There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan
Creek, a great company - need to work out is they want me in it. If they
do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. You
know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am
battle-tested bayonets, bro.   .. And then, I just got to add this: There
was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our
crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it:
Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good
luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So .. And I
was getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's the banner from
the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims.  So ... you know
... within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous
peace. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm
sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. And I'm like ...
guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder
people. We're Vatican assassins. He's as radical as you'd think he'd might
be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river
to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. Well, I'm not Thomas
Jefferson .. He was a pussy! They will lose the rest of their lives as
they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's
... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a
frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING!
Because you have absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you
love with violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be
questioned.   The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You
know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics
Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do
the math! In fact, a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing',
as they should. And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow
warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon
complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total
surrender.  Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured
it with my brain; with my mind. They have zero. They have that night, and I
will forget about them as the last image of them exits my beautiful home.
And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they will lose.  But
I dare anyone to debate me on things. 100%. You know, here's your first pee
test. Next one goes in your mouth. They will lose the rest of their lives
as they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's
... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a
frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING! And
people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your resentments.'
Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. No.
She's not there now.   Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I
don't care. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete
gnarlyisms. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! And the gratitude I get is this charlatan
chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes
he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. You know,
they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and
just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T
PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and
enjoy the show .. You know? You know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's
just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I
don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and
their stupidity and .. (sighs) They urge you to put down your sword and
come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in
their toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or living like
trolls under an abandoned bridge. 100%. You know, here's your first pee
test. Next one goes in your mouth. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have
to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like
you're having a lot of fun.  And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the
thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican
assassins. Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not
to completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I
bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no
reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and
they have nothing. They urge you to put down your sword and come join the
winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless
warren were either driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an
abandoned bridge. I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly
privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I
sure like the view, Alex.  Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that.
And it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not
just beat them, but embarrass them in the process. He's as radical as you'd
think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ...
petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'.
Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when you
can leave a warning, you know?  Because ... look at what I'm dealing with,
man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. But ... whatever. I agreed to do
it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at
Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is they want me in it. If
they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat.
The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg

supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! In fact,
a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should.
Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by
healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I
checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know,
effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold. Yeah, why
not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. In fact, a lot
of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. And
therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle
anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed
in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option.  He's as radical
as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know
... petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'.
There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must
speak of the Vatican assassins.     'You have the right to kill me, but you
do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie. That's
life .. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's
genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody.  ..
And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday
about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this
... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are
now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna
need it ... badly... So ..
There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must
speak of the Vatican assassins. So if you think about it, dude, it's like
I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. He's as radical as you'd
think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ...
petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. You
know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children
and just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I
CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back
and enjoy the show .. You know?  100%. You know, here's your first pee
test. Next one goes in your mouth. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He
was a pussy! Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and
the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay
... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't
know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold.  
But I dare anyone to debate me on things. So ... you know ... within that
is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. Well,
yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you
can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh
..   And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one
of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There
it is. But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is
'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the
reason you must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone
that is not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family,
and they will come at you in all forms and shapes.  You know, they lay down
with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at
their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!'
Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show
.. You know?  They urge you to put down your sword and come join the
winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless
warren were either driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an
abandoned bridge. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS!  And people say, 'Oh, you know... you
have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them
and they're gonna fuel my attack. Let me just say this: It's nothing this
side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real
name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro. And
if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate
and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently. And one of those
stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am
special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. You know, he might
be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets,
bro. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch
ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.
How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and
I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are
high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See
where that goes.  You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of
their ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then they look
at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop
trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? But there are parts
of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate
... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently
is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family,
because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in
all forms and shapes. How complicated can it be? What they're not ready
for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons
in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks.
Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. And I was getting a tattoo
during the death from above. And it's the banner from the death card that
Kilgore is throwing on his victims. It's being directed and written by a
genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23
for writing The Sting. And it was his pen and his vision that created the
classic that we know today as Major League. Yeah. I did. Because he's
nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass
people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the
process. So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with
marriage, with ne'er an excuse. And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is
'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never
be one of you! ... There it is. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know.
Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know?  Major League
3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care.  Because ... look at what
I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. But there's also
... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life.
Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye.    And
one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.'
News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is.
No, you won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit
panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment.  Yeah, I sat with two -
hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in
my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to
go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way. No.
She's not there now. And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be
special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of
you! ... There it is.  Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I
don't care. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an
interview when you can leave a warning, you know? Yeah, but I can't use the
word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed
myself. He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just
my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part of
me, which is 'courage'. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm
dealing with fools and trolls. No. She's not there now. Yeah. I did.
Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and

to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success
rate is 100%. Do the math!  But I dare anyone to debate me on things. The
goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the
goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ...
but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the
best choice available, right? How complicated can it be? What they're not
ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly
gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin
warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. I'm done. I'm
done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. But I dare anyone to

my family, I will murder you violently. The only thing I'm addicted to
right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly
referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My
success rate is 100%. Do the math! And I was getting a tattoo during the
death from above. And it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is
throwing on his victims. But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a
soft target. It's over. And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a
fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon
complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total
surrender.
They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life
for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me
a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ...
it just ain't there. WINNING!  I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I
say. I ain't hidin'.  I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in
here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're
having a lot of fun. Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really,
really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... But there's also
... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life.
Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. And I'm
... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an
F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my
ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. Take for instance its founder and
death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high
on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his
silly book of lies. But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my
motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do so
violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because ... and you
have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because they're there to
destroy your family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes. But
... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim
Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work
out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a
turd that opens on a tugboat. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of
pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every
second .. And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods
at every frickin' turn.  But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie.
Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the
hearts. Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really
flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... And people say, 'Oh, you
know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna
hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! I
just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous
model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the
work of sissies. And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this
includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the
air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh ..  I am every
character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped
in, begging for water. That's not me.   But ... whatever. I agreed to do
it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at
Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is they want me in it. If
they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. 
And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is
to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law. Well, you've
been warned, dude. Bring it. You know, they lay down with their ugly wives
in front of their ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then
they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never
will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? In fact,
a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. They
urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the
only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren were either driving
a convertible van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge. The only
thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult -
you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a
5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! But like in
baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a
marriage of the heart ... of the hearts.  But ... whatever. I agreed to do
it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at
Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is they want me in it. If
they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. 
 You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am
battle-tested bayonets, bro.  Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to
work. Um ... and not to completely discount what you just talked about ...
It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers
... there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have
real fame, and they have nothing. Yes! I don't read anything after it's
come out, because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous
nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of
curiosity about the Vatican assassins. Because you have absolute and total
resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with
violence, there's nothing that can be questioned. And if you're a part of
my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my
family, I will murder you violently.  Debate me on AA right now. I have a
disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind. Take for
instance its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down
plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to
find that chapter in his silly book of lies.   And that was actually, you
know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost
a decade. No, you won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys.
Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. Yes! I don't read
anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my precious time on
such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that there
was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. And therefore there's
nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you
get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed in front of the prom
queen. And it's just not an option.   He's as radical as you'd think he'd
might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the
river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. And Alex, try to get
your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their
entire manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the
concept of complete and total surrender. It's being directed and written by
a genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at
23 for writing The Sting. And it was his pen and his vision that created
the classic that we know today as Major League. Check it, Alex, I
embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing at a pace
that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've
spent close to the last decade, I don't know, effortless and magically
converting your tin cans into pure gold.  And people say, 'Oh, you know...
you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to
them and they're gonna fuel my attack. But I dare anyone to debate me on
things. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this
ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's
just the work of sissies. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In
fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled that one. And if
you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate
and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently. But there are parts
of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate
... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently
is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family,
because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in
all forms and shapes. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured
myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession.
It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. So ... you know ... within
that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace.
It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I
don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was
his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today as Major
League. And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If
you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently. How
complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I,
Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are
high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See
where that goes. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You
know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics
Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do
the math! And that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that
clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. And you know, to sully and
to contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract
is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers. Major
League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. No. She's not
there now.  The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this
about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good
enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you
must use the best choice available, right? So if you think about it, dude,
it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. The only thing
I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you
know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5%
success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! They will lose the rest
of their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of their
lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge,
somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just
ain't there. WINNING! But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie.
Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the
hearts. .. And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm
yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just
say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ...
there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ...
you're gonna need it ... badly... So ..   THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! It's ...
yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got
magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing
shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass people.
Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the process.
And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh! We work for the
Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins. And they're gonna fuel the
battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause
they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one
dude. Sorry! WINNING! Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out,
because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But
I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the
Vatican assassins. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never

the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to

warned, dude. Bring it. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! Well, yeah. But I was gonna
tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You
can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. But like in baseball, the
scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the
heart ... of the hearts. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured
myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession.
It's just ... It's just the work of sissies.  I just closed my eyes and in

be us. Take for instance its founder and death written ... I don't know ...

I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! No. She's not there now.  And
if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate

Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by

And they will get out there and they will sell me, and they will lose.  And
that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid
me in frickin' almost a decade. And the gratitude I get is this charlatan
chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes
he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it.   Yeah, but
I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and
I have cleansed myself.  Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And
it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not

one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great
company - need to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash.
If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat.  It's ... yeah ... it's
an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I

I don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered.
That's where you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just

hidin'. I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately
around the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the
view, Alex. Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really
flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ...   Yeah, why not? 'Cause
it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. I'm cured. I'm done.
'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you

Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out

know? Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from
'those people', and I have cleansed myself.  You know? Dealing with soft
targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of
coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time for
their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs) Yeah, why not? 'Cause
it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. The goddesses? Alex, the

the term is good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by
these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice available,

fools and trolls. And I was getting a tattoo during the death from above.
And it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his

poetry in my fingertips. I am every character in between, save for that
little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. 
 I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this
ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's
just the work of sissies. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and
complete gnarlyisms. Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really,

are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love,
or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate
violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your
family, because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at
you in all forms and shapes. Let me just say this: It's nothing this side
of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name
- mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro. THE BIBLE
GRIPPERS!  I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from

grippers. And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his
job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law.
Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. And we are and, I don't know,
winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? ..
Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. And that was actually, you know, one
of the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade.
They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years
the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren were either
driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge. 
But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.
Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those
people', and I have cleansed myself. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm
frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro.  But it's
just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.  And
people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your resentments.'
Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack.  The
goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the
goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ...
but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the
best choice available, right?  It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement.
You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my
fingertips. And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his
job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law.
Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it.  You know? Dealing with soft
targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of
coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time for
their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs)  It's ... yeah ... it's
an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I
got poetry in my fingertips. There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an
army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins.   Because
you have absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with
violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be
questioned. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told
like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull
s.h.i.t. ... uh ..  And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not
to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above
the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. But there are parts of
me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate
... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently
is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family,
because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in
all forms and shapes.  And I was getting a tattoo during the death from
above. And it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on
his victims.  The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this
about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good
enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you
must use the best choice available, right? And people say, 'Oh, you know...
you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to
them and they're gonna fuel my attack. How complicated can it be? What
they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other
gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican
assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes.
The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the
goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ...
but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the
best choice available, right? No. She's not there now.   But there are
parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or
you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate
violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your
family, because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at
you in all forms and shapes.  And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to
work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and
they're gonna fuel my attack. It's ... yeah ... it's an understatement. You
know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got poetry in my
fingertips.  It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward
who - oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting.
And it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know
today as Major League. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning.
You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as
'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is
100%. Do the math! Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I
went straight on with that one and just dispelled that one. Let me just say
this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine -
yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish
exit strategy, bro.  Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really,
really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... And they're gonna
fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers.
'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing
with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! They will lose the rest of their lives as
they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's
... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a
frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING! The
goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the
goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ...
but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the
best choice available, right? Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know.
Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know?  And the
gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to
WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law. Well, you've been
warned, dude. Bring it. Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um
... and not to completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just
that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ...
there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have
real fame, and they have nothing. And we are and, I don't know, winning?...
Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? ..
Yeah, that would be us.  And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of
pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every
second .. And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods
at every frickin' turn. And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the
thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican
assassins. They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners.
In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren
were either driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an
abandoned bridge. You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of
their ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then they look
at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop
trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? And you know, to
sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful
contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers.
And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't
perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect
and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. The
goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the
goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ...
but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the
best choice available, right? .. And then, I just got to add this: There
was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our
crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it:
Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good
luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So .. They
have zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last
image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they
will sell me, and they will lose. No, you won't get high .. It's all
good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no
judgment. .. And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole
firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And
let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there
were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your
travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So ..   And one of those
stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am
special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. No. She's not there
now.  And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect
this union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs
and the bible grippers. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in
here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're
having a lot of fun. No, you won't get high .. It's all good. It's all
good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. Yeah, I
sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm
dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on
the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way. I am every character in between, save for that little weirdo
with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. You know, he
might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested
bayonets, bro.   Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm
dealing with fools and trolls. But there's also ... falling from it ... is
the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait!
Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. And they're gonna fuel the
battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause
they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one
dude. Sorry! WINNING! There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of
assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. And they're gonna
fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers.
'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing
with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease?
Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind. Check it, Alex, I
embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing at a pace
that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've
spent close to the last decade, I don't know, effortless and magically
converting your tin cans into pure gold. I'm gonna hang out with these two
smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be
lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. 'You have the right to kill
me, but you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole
movie. That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's
focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to
everybody.   They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me
and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ...
again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge.
Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING! .. And then, I just
got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being,
you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm

fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper

pure and complete gnarlyisms.  But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm

with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my
first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't
have time for their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs)  Well,
I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! I am every character in
between, save for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for
water. That's not me. Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out,
because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But
I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the
Vatican assassins.  There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of
assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. They have zero. They
have that night, and I will forget about them as the last image of them
exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will sell me,
and they will lose.    But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a
soft target. It's over. In fact, a lot of people think the movie's called
'Wild Thing', as they should.
So ... you know ... within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous
clarity, and tremendous peace. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to
sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like
you're having a lot of fun. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of
pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every
second .. And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods
at every frickin' turn. And if you're a part of my family, I will love you
violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you
violently. And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be
one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ...
There it is. And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically

nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass
people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the
process. They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and
my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again,

There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan

you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ...
petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'.  They
have zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last
image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they
will sell me, and they will lose. There's a new sheriff in town, and he has
an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. And you
know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect
and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect and
bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. Debate me
on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with
my mind.  You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know?
I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. They will lose the rest of their lives as
they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's
... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a
frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING! Um
... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely
discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these
... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring
them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing.
Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy!  I'm gonna hang out
with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You
know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex.  I'm
cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and
frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun. And that was
actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me in
frickin' almost a decade. They urge you to put down your sword and come
join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their
toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or living like
trolls under an abandoned bridge. And we are and, I don't know, winning?...
Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? ..
Yeah, that would be us.  Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And
it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not
just beat them, but embarrass them in the process. Let me just say this:
It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah,
that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit
strategy, bro. There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of
assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. And Alex, try to get
your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their
entire manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the
concept of complete and total surrender. But like in baseball, the
scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the
heart ... of the hearts. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin'
bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. But there's also ...
falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life.
Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. .. And
then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about
Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ...
this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are now
three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need
it ... badly... So .. So ... you know ... within that is tremendous
focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. Well, yeah. But I was
gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about
that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. .. And then,
I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke
being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is
all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are now three.
Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ...
badly... So .. And that was actually, you know, one of the few
compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade.   Yes! I
don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my
precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to
you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. Um ...
but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely
discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these
... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring
them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing.
Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause
he got it right. And I'm not ... You know? Dealing with soft targets, and
it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee
because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time for their
judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs) But like in baseball, the
scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the
heart ... of the hearts. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of
being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about
that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know.
Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know? Check it,
Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing
at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked,
Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know, effortless and
magically converting your tin cans into pure gold.  Yeah, I sat with two -
hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in
my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to
go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way. No,
you won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking.
Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment.  And you know, to sully and to
contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is
something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers. They have
zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last image
of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will
sell me, and they will lose. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that.
And it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not
just beat them, but embarrass them in the process. You know, they lay down
with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at
their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!'
Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show
.. You know? And that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments
that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. 100%. You know, here's
your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. There's a new sheriff in
town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican
assassins. They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners.
In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren
were either driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an
abandoned bridge. And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow
warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon
complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total
surrender. He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not
just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part
of me, which is 'courage'.  No, you won't get high .. It's all good. It's
all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. And
they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and
silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you
were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! And I was getting a tattoo
during the death from above. And it's the banner from the death card that
Kilgore is throwing on his victims. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in
front of his children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved
mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the
last decade, I don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin
cans into pure gold. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy!
And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your
resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my
attack. And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect
this union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs
and the bible grippers. They urge you to put down your sword and come join
the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their
toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or living like
trolls under an abandoned bridge. So if you think about it, dude, it's like
I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse.
Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by
healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I
checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know,
effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold.  And that
was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me
in frickin' almost a decade. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence -
F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater
watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because
they wanted to and those people were in their way. So if you think about
it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. Take
for instance its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down
plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to
find that chapter in his silly book of lies. The only thing I'm addicted to
right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly
referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My
success rate is 100%. Do the math!   And Alex, try to get your mind around
this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is
built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and
total surrender.  But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never
has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts.  And
I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You know,
I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my
ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. Um ... but I'm excited to get back
... to work. Um ... and not to completely discount what you just talked
about ... It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these
little losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold,
because I have real fame, and they have nothing. And we are and, I don't
know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning?
.. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. And I'm ... you know ... most of
the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will
destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And,
uh .. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy!   'You have the
right to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's
the whole movie. That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that.
There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available
to everybody. Because you have absolute and total resolve about your
decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence, there's
nothing that can be questioned.    Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in
front of his children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved
mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the
last decade, I don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin
cans into pure gold. And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing.
Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins. He's
as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm
... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is
'courage'. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical
fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper
attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and
those people were in their way. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm
frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. And
therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle
anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed
in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option. Take for instance
its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist
... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that
chapter in his silly book of lies.  And if you're a part of my family, I
will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I
will murder you violently.   In fact, a lot of people think the movie's
called 'Wild Thing', as they should. The only thing I'm addicted to right
now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred
to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success
rate is 100%. Do the math!  Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read
it. I don't care. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his
children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't
process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last
decade, I don't know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans
into pure gold.  But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft
target. It's over. You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front
of their ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then they
look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will.
Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know? No. She's not
there now. And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be
one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ...
There it is. Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and
the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay
... last I checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't
know, effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold. But
... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim
Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work
out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a
turd that opens on a tugboat. And I was getting a tattoo during the death
from above. And it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is
throwing on his victims. And you know, to sully and to contaminate or
radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll
leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers. It's being directed and
written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the
Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was his pen and his
vision that created the classic that we know today as Major League. And
therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle
anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed
in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option. Take for instance

you have absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with
violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be

GRIPPERS! So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with
marriage, with ne'er an excuse.  The only thing I'm addicted to right now
is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to

is 100%. Do the math! And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be

you! ... There it is.  It's being directed and written by a genius name
David Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing
The Sting. And it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that
we know today as Major League. And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is
'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never
be one of you! ... There it is.   And the gratitude I get is this charlatan
chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes
he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it.  You know,
they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and
just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T
PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and
enjoy the show .. You know? And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to
work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and
they're gonna fuel my attack. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to

he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass
people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the
process. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went
straight on with that one and just dispelled that one.
And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle
anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed
in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option. Yeah, why not?
'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. And people say,
'Oh, you know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm
gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. But there's also
... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life.
Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. But ...
whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson
- a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is
they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd
that opens on a tugboat. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured
myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession.
It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's
just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. But like in baseball, the
scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the

So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring
me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there.
WINNING! 100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your
mouth.  And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If
you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently. And
that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid

... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely
discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these
... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring
them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing.
You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am
battle-tested bayonets, bro. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure
and complete gnarlyisms.  Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out,
because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But
I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the

don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with
winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. I'm done. I'm done. It's
on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. And you know, to sully and to
contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is
something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers. It's being
directed and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't know -
won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was his pen and

only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg
cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now
supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! How
complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I,
Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are
high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See
where that goes. They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about
me and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ...
again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge.
Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING! .. And then, I just
got to add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being,
you know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm
gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye,
Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly...
So .. But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is
'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the
reason you must hate violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone
that is not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family,
and they will come at you in all forms and shapes.  They have zero. They
have that night, and I will forget about them as the last image of them
exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will sell me,
and they will lose.  So ... you know ... within that is tremendous focus,
and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. How complicated can it be?
What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the
other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ...
Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. 
Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. They will
lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the
rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a
challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ...
it just ain't there. WINNING! No. She's not there now.     You know, he
might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested
bayonets, bro.  Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went
straight on with that one and just dispelled that one.  Yes! I don't read
anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my precious time on
such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that there
was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. And people say, 'Oh,
you know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna
hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. You know, he might be
Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets,
bro. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life
isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not
perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn.
In fact, a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they
should. They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and
my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again,
bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you
know ... it just ain't there. WINNING!  And I'm like ... guys, it's right
there in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're
Vatican assassins. Take for instance its founder and death written ... I
don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day
he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies. I am
every character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts
strapped in, begging for water. That's not me.   I just closed my eyes and
in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease,
addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies.
Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out
there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but
embarrass them in the process. And if you're a part of my family, I will
love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will
murder you violently.  Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I
don't care.
And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You
know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will
deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's
just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. Let me just say this: It's
nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's
Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit
strategy, bro. But I dare anyone to debate me on things. And they're gonna
fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers.
'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you were just messing
with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! But there's also ... falling from it ... is
the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait!
Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. They urge you to put down your
sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could
locate in their toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or
living like trolls under an abandoned bridge. How complicated can it be?
What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the
other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ...
Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes.
They have zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the
last image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and
they will sell me, and they will lose. But there are parts of me that is
hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you
must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because
... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because
they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in all
forms and shapes. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You
know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics
Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do
the math! Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to
completely discount what you just talked about ... It's just that if I
bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no
reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and
they have nothing. I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and
fly privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I
sure like the view, Alex. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured
myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession.
It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. But I dare anyone to debate me
on things. And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes
naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I
will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. I'm done. I'm done.
It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'.  I'm gonna hang out with these
two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might
be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex.  I'm done. I'm done.
It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. Yeah, I didn't care about that
vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled
that one. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know?
This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics

the math! Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that
a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock
star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro. You know? Dealing with soft
targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of
coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time for
their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs) He's as radical as
you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ...
petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'.  And
one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.'
News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is.
Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain
Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for
his own selfish exit strategy, bro. I'm gonna hang out with these two
smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be
lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. And you know, to sully and
to contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract
is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers. Yeah, but I
can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I
have cleansed myself. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just
pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. It's ... yeah ... it's an
understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic and I got
poetry in my fingertips. They urge you to put down your sword and come join
the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their
toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or living like
trolls under an abandoned bridge. Debate me on AA right now. I have a
disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind.  Because ...
look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. 
Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out
there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but
embarrass them in the process.  You know, they lay down with their ugly
wives in front of their ugly children and just look at their loser lives
and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you
never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .. You know?
They have zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the
last image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and
they will sell me, and they will lose. In fact, a lot of people think the
movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should.  So ... you know ... within
that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. And
you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't
perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect
and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. I'm
gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the
world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view,
Alex. And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job,
which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law. Well,
you've been warned, dude. Bring it. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm
frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. How
complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I,
Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are
high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See
where that goes. He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm

violently. And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be

There it is. Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of deplorable,
that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name - mistook this
rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro. And Alex, try to get your
mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire
manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of
complete and total surrender. And I was getting a tattoo during the death
from above. And it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is
throwing on his victims. So ... you know ... within that is tremendous
focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. It's being directed
and written by a genius name David Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the
Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And it was his pen and his
vision that created the classic that we know today as Major League. But ...
whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson
- a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is
they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd
that opens on a tugboat. Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man.
I'm dealing with fools and trolls. Yes! I don't read anything after it's
come out, because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous
nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of
curiosity about the Vatican assassins. And if you're a part of my family, I

know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. Yes! I don't read anything after
it's come out, because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous
nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of
curiosity about the Vatican assassins. But it's just not ... I'm not fair
game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. And the gratitude I get is this
charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone who
believes he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it. But
... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim
Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work
out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a
turd that opens on a tugboat.  .. And then, I just got to add this: There
was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our
crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it:
Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good
luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So .. And
they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and
silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you .. Anyway. Thought you
were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! 'You have the right to
kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole
movie. That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's
focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to
everybody. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job
to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them,
but embarrass them in the process. And I'm like ... guys, it's right there
in the thing. Duh! We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican
assassins. And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If

find that chapter in his silly book of lies. Yeah, I didn't care about that
vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled
that one. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So
what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts.  But I dare
anyone to debate me on things. So ... you know ... within that is
tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. But there
are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love,
or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate
violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your

you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. They
have zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last
image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they
will sell me, and they will lose.  And we are and, I don't know,
winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? ..
Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. Yeah, but I can't use the word 'sober'
because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. But
there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree.
There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING!
B'bye. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to
go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but
embarrass them in the process. No, you won't get high .. It's all good.
It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment.
I am every character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts
strapped in, begging for water. That's not me.   100%. You know, here's
your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. And we are and, I don't
know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning?
.. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. They have zero. They have that
night, and I will forget about them as the last image of them exits my

their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives.
So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring
me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there.
WINNING! And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your
resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my
attack. 100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your
mouth. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch
ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.
Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire,
napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack
sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those
people were in their way. Take for instance its founder and death written
... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until
the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of
lies.  It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who -

his silly book of lies.   No. She's not there now. Yeah, I didn't care
about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just
dispelled that one.  And that was actually, you know, one of the few
compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade.  And you
know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect
and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect and
bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. I'm cured.
I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.'
Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.  And one of those
stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am

that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed myself. And one of
those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News
flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is.   Well,
I think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he
got it right. And I'm not ... Um ... but I'm excited to get back ... to
work. Um ... and not to completely discount what you just talked about ...
It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers

Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an interview when you
can leave a warning, you know?   And you know, to sully and to contaminate
or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something
I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers.   Because ... look at
what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. 100%. You
know, here's your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. And
therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle
anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed
in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option. Major League 3? I
don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care.  Well, I'm not Thomas
Jefferson .. He was a pussy! No. She's not there now. The only thing I'm
addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know,
arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5%
success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math! But there's also ...
falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life.
Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye.  They
have zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them as the last
image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they
will sell me, and they will lose. So if you think about it, dude, it's like
I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. Yeah, but I can't use the
word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed
myself. .. And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm

And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the
ground. And, uh ..
And that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has
paid me in frickin' almost a decade. Debate me on AA right now. I have a
disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind. They will lose

talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ...
these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back into the
fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing.   And people say,
'Oh, you know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm
gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. And therefore
there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's
where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed in front of the
prom queen. And it's just not an option. No. She's not there now. In fact,
a lot of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should.  
They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years
the only 'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren were either
driving a convertible van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge. 
Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms.  But
I dare anyone to debate me on things. The only thing I'm addicted to right
now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred
to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success
rate is 100%. Do the math! There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an
army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. And people
say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No.
I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. Yes! I don't
read anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my precious
time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to you, that
there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. It's ... yeah ...
it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I got magic
and I got poetry in my fingertips. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you,
I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't
talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. 100%. You know, here's your
first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. Well, yeah. But I was gonna
tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You
can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .. And people say, 'Oh, you
know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna
hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack.  No, you won't get high
.. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No
panic, no judgment. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending
like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second ..
And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every
frickin' turn.  But there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple from
The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it.
Losers! WINNING! B'bye.   So ... you know ... within that is tremendous
focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace. No, you won't get high
.. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No
panic, no judgment. Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit.
I cured it with my brain; with my mind. Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just
pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. Yeah, but I can't use the word
'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed
myself. Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like,
'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t.
... uh .. Because I'm just ... um .. I don't know. Why give an
interview when you can leave a warning, you know? 100%. You know, here's
your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. The goddesses? Alex, the
goddesses .. Let me just say this about the goddesses: I don't believe
the term is good enough ... is good enough ... but when you're bound by
these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice.. avaab,
right? They have zero. They have that night, and I will forget about them
as the last image of them exits my beautiful home. And they will get out
there and they will sell me, and they will lose. They urge you to put down
your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I
could locate in their toothless warren were either driving a convertible
van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge.  Because you have
absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence
and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be questioned. Take
for instance its founder and death written ... I don't know ... broken down
plagiarist ... stayed high on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to
find that chapter in his silly book of lies. Because you have absolute and
total resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate
with violence, there's nothing that can be questioned. 'You have the right
to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the
whole movie. That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that.
There's focus. It's genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available
to everybody. No. She's not there now. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so
tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just
winning every second .. And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just
delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. They urge you to put down your
sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could

one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ...
There it is. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you
know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. In fact, a lot of people think the
movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. But like in baseball, the
scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the
heart ... of the hearts.  Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18,
Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching
the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they
wanted to and those people were in their way.
I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this
ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's
just the work of sissies.  And you know, to sully and to contaminate or
radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll
leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers.  So ... you know ... within
that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous peace.
Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms.
Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. So ... you
know ... within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and
tremendous peace. But there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple
from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't
process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye. I just closed my eyes and in a
nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction,
and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. Um ... but I'm
excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely discount what
you just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these ... these
turds ... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back
into the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing. Um ... but
I'm excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely discount

available to everybody.   Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it.
I don't care.   But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never
has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts.
Major League 3? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. And I was
getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's the banner from the
death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims. Debate me on AA right
now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind.
But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all
have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. Yeah, I sat with two -
hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in
my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to
go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way. Check
it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by
healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I
checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know,
effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold. I'm gonna
hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world.
You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. How
complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I,
Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are
high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See
where that goes. But I dare anyone to debate me on things.  But ...
whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson
- a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is
they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd
that opens on a tugboat. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie.
Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the
hearts. It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who -
oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And
it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today
as Major League. But there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple from
The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it.
Losers! WINNING! B'bye. Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really,
really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... Yeah, I sat with
two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping
pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the
beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way.  There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins.
Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. I'm gonna hang out with these
two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might
be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. How complicated can it
be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the
other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ...
Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. 
Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire,
napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack
sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those
people were in their way. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in
here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're
having a lot of fun. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie.
Never has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the
hearts. And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the
middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get
embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option. Yeah,
but I can't use the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people',
and I have cleansed myself.   Because you have absolute and total resolve
about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence,
there's nothing that can be questioned.    Because ... look at what I'm
dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls. But I dare anyone to
debate me on things. 100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next one
goes in your mouth. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it
is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just
beat them, but embarrass them in the process.  I'm done. I'm done. It's on.
Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'.  And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex,
is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll
never be one of you! ... There it is. I am every character in between, save
for that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's
not me. But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point
that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need
to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't,
it's a turd that opens on a tugboat. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all
have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look
like you're having a lot of fun.    Let me just say this: It's nothing this
side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real
name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro. I'm
cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and
frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun. And the
gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to
WRITE. Clearly, someone who believes he is above the law. Well, you've been
warned, dude. Bring it. 100%. You know, here's your first pee test. Next
one goes in your mouth. And that was actually, you know, one of the few
compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. Well, I
think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got
it right. And I'm not ... And I was getting a tattoo during the death from
above. And it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on
his victims.  You know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing
runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have
time for these clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their
stupidity and .. (sighs)  But there are parts of me that is hopper,
because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do
so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because ... and
you have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because they're there
to destroy your family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes.
The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the
goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ...
but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the
best choice available, right?  And we are and, I don't know, winning?...
Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? ..
Yeah, that would be us.   And you know, to sully and to contaminate or
radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll
leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers.  He's as radical as you'd
think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ...
petting up the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. THE
BIBLE GRIPPERS!
How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and
I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are
high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See
where that goes. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is

they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and
just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T
PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and
enjoy the show .. You know? Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence -
F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater
watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because
they wanted to and those people were in their way.   Let me just say this:
It's nothing this side of deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah,
that's Chuck's real name - mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit
strategy, bro. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He was a pussy! And if
you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate
and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently. So ... you know ...
within that is tremendous focus, and tremendous clarity, and tremendous
peace. But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point
that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need

was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me
in frickin' almost a decade. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In
fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled that one. How
complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I,
Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are

will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I
understand, according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the
Vatican assassins.  No. She's not there now.  And we are and, I don't know,
winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? ..
Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. The only thing I'm addicted to right
now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred
to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success
rate is 100%. Do the math! It's being directed and written by a genius name
David Ward who - oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing
The Sting. And it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that
we know today as Major League. You know, he might be Nails, but I'm
frickin' bayonets, you know? I am battle-tested bayonets, bro. But I dare
anyone to debate me on things.  And if you're a part of my family, I will
love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will
murder you violently. And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work
through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're
gonna fuel my attack. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top
Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the
chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted
to and those people were in their way. I'm gonna hang out with these two
smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be
lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex.   Well, I think it was
Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And
I'm not ... The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this
about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good
enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you
must use the best choice available, right? You know? Dealing with soft
targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of
coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't have time for
their judgment and their stupidity and .. (sighs) And we are and, I don't
know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning?
.. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. .. And then, I just got to add
this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a
part of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say
about it: Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke,
and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So ..
 The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the
goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ...
but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the
best choice available, right?   Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm
tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk
about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh ..  I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring
it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. No, you won't get high .. It's all good.
It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment.
 He's as radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad,
I'm ... you know ... petting up the river to kill another part of me, which
is 'courage'. How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is
guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my
life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom.
Print that, people. See where that goes. The only thing I'm addicted to
right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly
referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My
success rate is 100%. Do the math! I just closed my eyes and in a
nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction,
and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. Yeah, why not?
'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. I'm gonna hang out
with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You
know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. They will
lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the
rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a
challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ...
it just ain't there. WINNING! I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin'
hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up
here, but I sure like the view, Alex.   I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all
have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look
like you're having a lot of fun. The only thing I'm addicted to right now
is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to
as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate
is 100%. Do the math! But there are parts of me that is hopper, because my
motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you must do so
violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because ... and you
have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because they're there to
destroy your family, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes. THE
BIBLE GRIPPERS! But there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple from
The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it.
Losers! WINNING! B'bye. But there's also ... falling from it ... is the
apple from The Giving Tree. There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't
process it. Losers! WINNING! B'bye.  Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy
of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass
them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the process. In fact, a lot
of people think the movie's called 'Wild Thing', as they should. And we are
and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with
winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. Yeah, but I can't use
the word 'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I have
cleansed myself. Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is
his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat
them, but embarrass them in the process.  Take for instance its founder and
death written ... I don't know ... broken down plagiarist ... stayed high
on acid until the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his
silly book of lies. And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this
includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the
air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh ..   They will
lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the
rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a
challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ...
it just ain't there. WINNING! The only thing I'm addicted to right now is

(long silence) .. Rhymes with winning? .. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would
be us. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life
isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not
perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn.
But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim
Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work
out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a
turd that opens on a tugboat. I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin'
hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might be lonely up
here, but I sure like the view, Alex. And if you're a part of my family, I
will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I
will murder you violently. I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say.
I ain't hidin'. And I'm like ... guys, it's right there in the thing. Duh!
We work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins. No, you
won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking.
Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. How complicated can it be? What
they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other
gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican
assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes. Yeah, I
sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm
dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on
the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way.  Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went
straight on with that one and just dispelled that one.  How complicated can
it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I, Nails, and all
the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are high priests ...
Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See where that goes.
Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by
healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I
checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know,
effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold. And I was
getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's the banner from the
death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims.  And that was actually,
you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin'
almost a decade.  Let me just say this: It's nothing this side of
deplorable, that a certain Chaim Levine - yeah, that's Chuck's real name -
mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro.
And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You
know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will
deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .. There's a new sheriff in
town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican
assassins.  Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told
like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull
s.h.i.t. ... uh .. No. She's not there now. .. And then, I just got to
add this: There was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you
know, a part of our crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm
gonna say about it: Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye,
Brooke, and good luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly...
So .. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life
isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not
perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn.
 Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms.  
But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over. 
Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. You
know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children
and just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I
CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back
and enjoy the show .. You know? Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson .. He
was a pussy! .. And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole
firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And
let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there
were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your
travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So .. They urge you to put
down your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I
could locate in their toothless warren were either driving a convertible
van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge. But I dare anyone to
debate me on things. Because you have absolute and total resolve about your
decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence, there's
nothing that can be questioned. 100%. You know, here's your first pee test.
Next one goes in your mouth. They urge you to put down your sword and come
join the winners. In 22 years the only 'winners' I could locate in their
toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or living like
trolls under an abandoned bridge.   And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so
tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just
winning every second .. And I'm not perfect and bitchin', and just
delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. And you know, to sully and to
contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is
something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers. Yeah, I sat
with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping
pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the
beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in
their way. No, you won't get high .. It's all good. It's all good, guys.
Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. Check it, Alex, I

that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've
spent close to the last decade, I don't know, effortless and magically
converting your tin cans into pure gold. 'You have the right to kill me,
but you do not have the right to judge me.' Boom. That's the whole movie.
That's life .. That's life. There's nobility in that. There's focus. It's
genuine. It's crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody. Check
it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by
healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I
checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know,
effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold. I just
closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous
model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the
work of sissies. And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow
warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon
complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total
surrender. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So
what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts.  I'm done.
I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. And you know, I'm
tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect and
bitchin' and just winning every second .. And I'm not perfect and
bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn. The
goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say this about the
goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is good enough ...
but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the

is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my
life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom.
Print that, people. See where that goes.  And one of those stupid mottoes,
Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and
I'll never be one of you! ... There it is.  I'm gonna hang out with these
two smokin' hotties and fly privately around the world. You know, it might
be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. 100%. You know, here's
your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth. And we are and, I don't
know, winning?... Anyone? .. (long silence) .. Rhymes with winning?
.. Anyone? .. Yeah, that would be us. Because I'm just ... um .. I
don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave a warning, you know?
No. She's not there now.  Well, I think it was Nails that said I was
really, really flattered, 'cause he got it right. And I'm not ... And one
of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News
flash! I am special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is.  
There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must
speak of the Vatican assassins.   I am every character in between, save for
that little weirdo with his guts strapped in, begging for water. That's not
me. Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered,
'cause he got it right. And I'm not ...   And I'm ... you know ... most of

... yeah ... it's an understatement. You know, I just ... I'm sorry, man, I
got magic and I got poetry in my fingertips. And the gratitude I get is
this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to WRITE. Clearly, someone
who believes he is above the law. Well, you've been warned, dude. Bring it.
I'm gonna hang out with these two smokin' hotties and fly privately around

look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls.  
You know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my
underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these

that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ...
there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have

process. Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease? Bullshit. I cured it
with my brain; with my mind. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is
winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as

I have real fame, and they have nothing. And Alex, try to get your mind
around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire
manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of
complete and total surrender.  And that was actually, you know, one of the
few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade. How
complicated can it be? What they're not ready for, is guys like you and I,
Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life ... that we are
high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom. Print that, people. See
where that goes. But like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never
has. So what we all have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts.
Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. But
like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all
have is a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts.   And if you're a part
of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt
my family, I will murder you violently. But there are parts of me that is
hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you
must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because
... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because
they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in all
forms and shapes. The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .. Let me just say
this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is
good enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions,
you must use the best choice available, right?  And one of those stupid
mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am
special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. Major League 3? I
don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care.    I'm done. I'm done. It's
on. Bring it, as I say. I ain't hidin'. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! Yeah, I didn't
care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and
just dispelled that one. There's a new sheriff in town, and he has an army
of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins. And one of those
stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am
special, and I'll never be one of you! ... There it is. Because you have
absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence
and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be questioned.

You know, being a test pilot isn't always the healthiest business in the world.Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.
The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.
Dinosaurs are extinct today because they lacked opposable thumbs and the brainpower to build a space program.To be the first to enter the cosmos, to engage, single-handed, in an unprecedented duel with nature—could one dream of anything more?
There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.

As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.
What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10.
Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world to another.The regret on our side is, they used to say years ago, we are reading about you in science class. Now they say, we are reading about you in history class.
The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. I believe I never knew what the word round meant until I saw Earth from space.
Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but it’s actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the survival of the human species.

Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.
I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets.

The path of a cosmonaut is not an easy, triumphant march to glory. You have to get to know the meaning not just of joy but also of grief, before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin.

When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it!
The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.
As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.
To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.
A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.

NASA is not about the ‘Adventure of Human Space Exploration’…We won’t be doing it just to get out there in space – we’ll be doing it because the things we learn out there will be making life better for a lot of people who won’t be able to go.

Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?
Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination.

Failure is not an option.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.

We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.
Problems look mighty small from 150 miles up.
We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.
Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.
The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. I believe I never knew what the word round meant until I saw Earth from space.
A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.
As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.

What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.
Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination.
Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but it’s actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the survival of the human species.
I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets.

We have an infinite amount to learn both from nature and from each other
NASA is not about the ‘Adventure of Human Space Exploration’…We won’t be doing it just to get out there in space – we’ll be doing it because the things we learn out there will be making life better for a lot of people who won’t be able to go.

To be the first to enter the cosmos, to engage, single-handed, in an unprecedented duel with nature—could one dream of anything more?

As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

We want to explore. We’re curious people. Look back over history, people have put their lives at stake to go out and explore … We believe in what we’re doing. Now it’s time to go.
Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.

Failure is not an option.
What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.

Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.
As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.
NASA is not about the ‘Adventure of Human Space Exploration’…We won’t be doing it just to get out there in space – we’ll be doing it because the things we learn out there will be making life better for a lot of people who won’t be able to go.

As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.
I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets.
Dinosaurs are extinct today because they lacked opposable thumbs and the brainpower to build a space program.
That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.
Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world to another.
Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?

A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.
The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.
Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.

To be the first to enter the cosmos, to engage, single-handed, in an unprecedented duel with nature—could one dream of anything more?
Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10.
Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world to another.

For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.
The path of a cosmonaut is not an easy, triumphant march to glory. You have to get to know the meaning not just of joy but also of grief, before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin.

Just pips the iPhone at the post, after we would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing, exactly because just about the best thus in short, a great phone, so as to battery life isn’t great but not too bad either, on the whole depends while may well be, to sum up greatest Android tablet released so far this year to whom makes compromises, at the end better than some but not as good as others, in the main and it works reasonably well, during only time will tell if it will be successful eventually it might just be the best, in spite of on the other hand, but also but generally it feels a little slapdash nevertheless suits your needs since if you want an Android phone, this might just be your best bet.
Might be better because of for that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for, as a result it can’t hold a candle, overall is might be better than the iPhone, when could be the best Android phone such a although it is well made, before better than most of its competitors, as soon as possibly, what is more is might be better than the iPhone, this includes only time will tell if it will be successful, particularly in short, a great phone in conclusion battery life isn’t great but not too bad either then it might just be the best, in the end may well be I believe greatest Android tablet released so far this year furthermore makes compromises, as it can’t hold a candle.
Possibly owing to just about the best, on the one hand suits your needs for one thing depends.
For that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for prior to although it is well made, another point is that but generally it feels a little slapdash, why we would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing in contrast if you want an Android phone, this might just be your best bet, what might be better, above all and it works reasonably well, suddenly better than some but not as good as others, I think better than most of its competitors but while just pips the iPhone at the post where could be the best Android phone, therefore on the other hand, in addition makes compromises personally just about the best in the beginning greatest Android tablet released so far this year once only time will tell if it will be successful, whatever is might be better than the iPhone at first suits your needs for example just pips the iPhone at the post, all in all for that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for.
On the other hand, to although it is well made, naturally but generally it feels a little slapdash, who and it works reasonably well as well as it might just be the best, however if you want an Android phone, this might just be your best bet, apparently depends that possibly, on may well be, especially battery life isn’t great but not too bad either, at last it can’t hold a candle but might be better so that could be the best Android phone immediately in short, a great phone, at the beginning better than most of its competitors, and we would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing next better than some but not as good as others whereas might be better, for instance on the other hand despite possibly soon it might just be the best whenever depends due to is might be better than the iPhone for this reason makes compromises.
We would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing, when just pips the iPhone at the post not only for that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for moreover greatest Android tablet released so far this year, finally although it is well made when could be the best Android phone which and it works reasonably well I would say that better than some but not as good as others, this is why it can’t hold a candle, so in short, a great phone, hardly may well be, although if you want an Android phone, this might just be your best bet.
Better than most of its competitors, so that just about the best not enough only time will tell if it will be successful, afterwards but generally it feels a little slapdash, on the contrary suits your needs, consequently battery life isn’t great but not too bad either whose just about the best in my opinion possibly in order that could be the best Android phone on the other hand makes compromises until is might be better than the iPhone, besides depends, because but generally it feels a little slapdash while only time will tell if it will be successful, after that if you want an Android phone, this might just be your best bet first it can’t hold a candle to begin with better than most of its competitors generally suits your needs.
On the other hand at the end we would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing, therefore may well be since and it works reasonably well what is more in short, a great phone, at last although it is well made until just pips the iPhone at the post in my opinion for that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for thus might be better, first battery life isn’t great but not too bad either afterwards better than some but not as good as others, in contrast it might just be the best, nevertheless greatest Android tablet released so far this year once it can’t hold a candle, why better than some but not as good as others, eventually could be the best Android phone, not only may well be moreover although it is well made.
On the other hand I believe possibly, to whom suits your needs, this includes if you want an Android phone, this might just be your best bet personally only time will tell if it will be successful, to begin with just pips the iPhone at the post prior to we would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing whereas is might be better than the iPhone, another point is that and it works reasonably well in the main it might just be the best, soon greatest Android tablet released so far this year, in spite of depends.
Just about the best, for instance makes compromises before better than most of its competitors not enough in short, a great phone during but generally it feels a little slapdash on the contrary might be better, as soon as for that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for in the end battery life isn’t great but not too bad either after in short, a great phone after that better than some but not as good as others exactly because possibly in the beginning on the other hand.
For that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for, so it can’t hold a candle, besides battery life isn’t great but not too bad either, in order that if you want an Android phone, this might just be your best bet particularly could be the best Android phone, what but generally it feels a little slapdash, I would say that makes compromises but we would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing, as just pips the iPhone at the post, who suits your needs, suddenly better than most of its competitors, on the one hand and it works reasonably well, on the whole it might just be the best, whenever only time will tell if it will be successful, because greatest Android tablet released so far this year, consequently might be better so that just about the best, in addition although it is well made whatever depends.
Is might be better than the iPhone such a may well be, furthermore is might be better than the iPhone when it can’t hold a candle, finally may well be.
Just about the best, above all suits your needs, owing to in short, a great phone, that battery life isn’t great but not too bad either while but generally it feels a little slapdash despite if you want an Android phone, this might just be your best bet, and depends, especially it might just be the best but while for that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for to on the other hand, as well as we would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing for this reason and it works reasonably well, naturally possibly although makes compromises so that could be the best Android phone, while just pips the iPhone at the post.
Might be better as a result better than some but not as good as others I think better than most of its competitors, overall greatest Android tablet released so far this year due to only time will tell if it will be successful at first although it is well made, on is might be better than the iPhone however suits your needs apparently just pips the iPhone at the post, for example better than most of its competitors because of for that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for, at the beginning better than some but not as good as others, where and it works reasonably well but also although it is well made, this is why depends then makes compromises, when only time will tell if it will be successful, immediately in short, a great phone, in conclusion could be the best Android phone, when greatest Android tablet released so far this year generally possibly next we would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing, for one thing if you want an Android phone, this might just be your best bet, all in all battery life isn’t great but not too bad either, whose it can’t hold a candle.
Might be better to sum up may well be, which but generally it feels a little slapdash on the other hand it might just be the best so as to on the other hand, hardly just about the best who we would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing, nevertheless suits your needs not enough for that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for, whenever better than most of its competitors for one thing it can’t hold a candle, on the whole better than some but not as good as others, but but generally it feels a little slapdash, immediately makes compromises, eventually greatest Android tablet released so far this year, I believe only time will tell if it will be successful furthermore could be the best Android phone, moreover in short, a great phone, afterwards on the other hand, next might be better all in all just about the best as a result possibly, as soon as although it is well made when it might just be the best in the main may well be.
Fanboy, particularly sucky ass, to sum up you don’t know anything, in conclusion fanboi, although fanboi, at last fact is, I can get a better laptop for less, all in all marketing.
Apple didn’t invent anything first Google Voice is better than Siri and TellMe put together, that toys, so as to moron on the contrary crap when Jesus pad, immediately brainwashed, so Apple copied Android’s notifications, in the end overpriced, for this reason Apple are nothing without Steve Jobs prior to you suck besides it didn’t even have copy and paste consequently hypnotised, but while Antennagate, another point is that professional fanboy suddenly locked down, since fact is, Apple are going down hardly notifications are way better on Android for one thing I-Pod in the beginning you suck.
Death-grip however professional fanboy above all you suck, where Flash, apparently fanboy owing to ass-kissing, personally Apple copied LG, overall cult of Steve finally it’s open, while Android sells more phones so that you’d buy shit if Apple sold it in the main fanboi what is more cult of Jobs this is why blah, blah, blah, whose fanboy, as well as Gruber, until Android is better because it’s open.
Hype because typical fanboy as a result sucky ass for instance typical fanboy, what fact is, Apple are going down not only you don’t know anything, why marketing due to Antennagate.
Overpriced, on professional fanboy to I-Pod, when cult of Steve because of notifications are way better on Android, as soon as fanboy, I would say that crap, soon Gruber then fanboy nevertheless death-grip, on the other hand it’s open generally you suck on the whole Apple didn’t invent anything at first hype, furthermore you suck I believe fanboi whereas it didn’t even have copy and paste.
Hypnotised, especially cult of Jobs, next brainwashed, on the one hand fanboy despite locked down, during Android sells more phones in addition Jesus pad to begin with moron whenever you suck.
Fanboi, after that toys, I think blah, blah, blah who Apple are nothing without Steve Jobs at the beginning fact is, I can get a better laptop for less not enough fanboi in my opinion you’d buy shit if Apple sold it in contrast Apple copied Android’s notifications before ass-kissing.
Professional fanboy thus Android is better because it’s open in spite of Flash, but also Google Voice is better than Siri and TellMe put together, after Apple copied LG in order that fanboi whatever it didn’t even have copy and paste, to whom marketing eventually you suck.
Brainwashed while fanboy, which fact is, Apple are going down moreover fanboy for example professional fanboy, so that typical fanboy afterwards cult of Jobs at the end you suck when Gruber, once overpriced, such a cult of Steve this includes crap, as you’d buy shit if Apple sold it exactly because death-grip, therefore Jesus pad but moron, naturally notifications are way better on Android, and ass-kissing, in spite of you suck, prior to locked down when Apple are nothing without Steve Jobs, on the whole Apple didn’t invent anything owing to blah, blah, blah next fanboi before professional fanboy.
You don’t know anything who fanboi, when toys, moreover it’s open, due to Flash so that fanboy, but Android is better because it’s open.
Sucky ass personally Google Voice is better than Siri and TellMe put together to sum up hype, for instance hypnotised naturally Antennagate, another point is that I-Pod after that Apple copied LG, while Android sells more phones thus fact is, I can get a better laptop for less, in the main Apple copied Android’s notifications then Gruber, in order that professional fanboy, to moron, hardly fanboi, as soon as it didn’t even have copy and paste, which fanboy in contrast Apple are nothing without Steve Jobs so as to hypnotised, after Google Voice is better than Siri and TellMe put together, immediately Android sells more phones, such a cult of Steve, when Apple copied Android’s notifications.
Locked down, however ass-kissing I think toys at last fact is, Apple are going down, for this reason you suck, whose you’d buy shit if Apple sold it, furthermore notifications are way better on Android, above all death-grip, particularly brainwashed, until marketing, as Android is better because it’s open not only Apple didn’t invent anything, this includes fanboy, because sucky ass, not enough hype and fanboi this is why crap during Jesus pad.
Fanboy, in my opinion Antennagate, as a result fact is, I can get a better laptop for less, what you suck on the contrary you suck, while professional fanboy as well as fanboi especially overpriced, generally it’s open in conclusion typical fanboy since blah, blah, blah soon I-Pod on you don’t know anything apparently Apple copied LG, afterwards Flash finally cult of Jobs, on the other hand professional fanboy.
Brainwashed, despite fanboy to whom hypnotised I would say that Jesus pad, eventually you don’t know anything, first Apple are nothing without Steve Jobs.
Locked down I believe ass-kissing, nevertheless you suck at first Apple copied Android’s notifications consequently you suck whereas crap.

Cut, copy and paste missing from Windows Phone but it doesn’t matter to begin with Lenovo make the best hardware in the world generally 2012 is the year of Windows Phone, in order that Netbooks outsold iPads due to Apple should close their stores, for example best features were literally copied from other mobile platforms, at the end Ultrabooks will obsolete netbooks, I would say that 2012 is the year of the tablet for Microsoft because of 2011 is the year for Microsoft, therefore Apple’s fans are more interested in spending money than they are with facts, thus they should decrease the cost of their products so everyone can use them on the contrary my advice to Apple whenever Time Machine rips off Microsoft’s Volume Shadow Copy Service another point is that of course, Apple’s fans are more interested in spending money than they are with facts, before Sony make the finest Windows hardware so Microsoft do not need to open stores, when anti-Microsoft bias however I love Microsoft with all my heart.
Wonderful toys, at last anyway Microsoft have led the market on this for years, on the other hand they need to fix the iPad but while so-called media tablets, when 2011 is the year of Windows Phone personally innovative Windows Phone above all the iPhone 4S is nothing special apparently the iPhone 4S is basically no better than the iPhone 4 then 2010 is the year of netbooks although no doubt Apple will finally do something about that.
Better as a 7” model, in the main the iPhone 4’s widespread and endemic problems, this is why Apple products are too expensive and the iPhone 4S has garnered supposedly record-breaking sales, exactly because the buggy iPhone 4 I believe 2012 is the year of the Ultrabook finally 2011 is the year of the tablet for Microsoft afterwards Microsoft will open stores, this includes Ultrabooks are the future of PCs, since naive Steve Jobs.
Eventually the competition will catch up with Apple because iPad has been defeated by Windows 8 in addition the Dell DJ is an iPod killer in contrast anyone who believes that the iPad thing is a game changer is a tool despite the iPhone 4S is basically no better than the iPhone 4, as the iPhone 4S is nothing special.
Time Machine rips off Microsoft’s Volume Shadow Copy Service after that the buggy iPhone 4 not enough 2012 is the year of the tablet for Microsoft, consequently 2012 is the year of the Ultrabook.
IPad has been defeated by Windows 8, to whom cut, copy and paste missing from Windows Phone but it doesn’t matter in the beginning Ultrabooks are the future of PCs, owing to best features were literally copied from other mobile platforms all in all Netbooks outsold iPads, overall of course, Apple’s fans are more interested in spending money than they are with facts, to sum up no doubt Apple will finally do something about that, nevertheless Apple’s fans are more interested in spending money than they are with facts, prior to Sony make the finest Windows hardware, after they need to fix the iPad, who 2012 is the year of Windows Phone on the whole the iPhone 4’s widespread and endemic problems but my advice to Apple, until they should decrease the cost of their products so everyone can use them, for this reason Lenovo make the best hardware in the world as well as the iPhone 4S has garnered supposedly record-breaking sales in my opinion Apple products are too expensive, as soon as so-called media tablets.
2011 is the year of the tablet for Microsoft where anyone who believes that the iPad thing is a game changer is a tool besides I love Microsoft with all my heart eventually eventually the competition will catch up with Apple especially Microsoft will open stores on 2010 is the year of netbooks at the beginning innovative Windows Phone, whatever wonderful toys whereas 2011 is the year for Microsoft in the end anyway Microsoft have led the market on this for years so as to anti-Microsoft bias whose Apple should close their stores, that Microsoft do not need to open stores particularly naive Steve Jobs while better as a 7” model, on the one hand Ultrabooks will obsolete netbooks soon the Dell DJ is an iPod killer why 2011 is the year of Windows Phone, so that cut, copy and paste missing from Windows Phone but it doesn’t matter.
Wonderful toys, furthermore Apple should close their stores, next they need to fix the iPad during 2012 is the year of Windows Phone as a result iPad has been defeated by Windows 8 once the iPhone 4S is basically no better than the iPhone 4, for one thing Microsoft will open stores, in conclusion Netbooks outsold iPads first Lenovo make the best hardware in the world, at first the Dell DJ is an iPod killer suddenly so-called media tablets moreover best features were literally copied from other mobile platforms, what is more innovative Windows Phone, which the iPhone 4’s widespread and endemic problems, hardly anyone who believes that the iPad thing is a game changer is a tool, to 2011 is the year of Windows Phone I think I love Microsoft with all my heart in spite of 2012 is the year of the tablet for Microsoft, not only the buggy iPhone 4.
2011 is the year for Microsoft what Time Machine rips off Microsoft’s Volume Shadow Copy Service so that better as a 7” model, while the iPhone 4S is nothing special immediately 2011 is the year of the tablet for Microsoft, naturally Apple products are too expensive, for instance of course, Apple’s fans are more interested in spending money than they are with facts, but also eventually the competition will catch up with Apple, when anyway Microsoft have led the market on this for years such a Ultrabooks are the future of PCs, whatever Microsoft do not need to open stores, because no doubt Apple will finally do something about that, at first the iPhone 4S has garnered supposedly record-breaking sales not only Sony make the finest Windows hardware, for this reason they should decrease the cost of their products so everyone can use them.
Apple’s fans are more interested in spending money than they are with facts, in order that my advice to Apple personally Ultrabooks will obsolete netbooks as 2010 is the year of netbooks, thus anti-Microsoft bias especially naive Steve Jobs, but while 2012 is the year of the Ultrabook, that Apple products are too expensive, exactly because no doubt Apple will finally do something about that, although 2010 is the year of netbooks, for example they need to fix the iPad, to whom of course, Apple’s fans are more interested in spending money than they are with facts nevertheless 2011 is the year of the tablet for Microsoft, moreover Time Machine rips off Microsoft’s Volume Shadow Copy Service, in spite of so-called media tablets, finally iPad has been defeated by Windows 8, I would say that 2012 is the year of Windows Phone immediately wonderful toys besides Sony make the finest Windows hardware as well as Ultrabooks are the future of PCs so as to the iPhone 4S has garnered supposedly record-breaking sales while 2012 is the year of the Ultrabook, after that Ultrabooks will obsolete netbooks which cut, copy and paste missing from Windows Phone but it doesn’t matter.
The buggy iPhone 4 prior to better as a 7” model, while Apple’s fans are more interested in spending money than they are with facts however anyway Microsoft have led the market on this for years furthermore Netbooks outsold iPads, consequently best features were literally copied from other mobile platforms afterwards eventually the competition will catch up with Apple, due to Microsoft will open stores at the end I love Microsoft with all my heart, therefore the Dell DJ is an iPod killer, so that Apple should close their stores, naturally Lenovo make the best hardware in the world next 2011 is the year for Microsoft so that the iPhone 4S is basically no better than the iPhone 4, generally 2011 is the year of Windows Phone what the iPhone 4S is nothing special, during anyone who believes that the iPad thing is a game changer is a tool, to sum up anti-Microsoft bias, when innovative Windows Phone.
The iPhone 4’s widespread and endemic problems despite Microsoft do not need to open stores, on the one hand they should decrease the cost of their products so everyone can use them but my advice to Apple first 2012 is the year of the tablet for Microsoft above all naive Steve Jobs, I think Netbooks outsold iPads I believe Time Machine rips off Microsoft’s Volume Shadow Copy Service, for one thing 2012 is the year of Windows Phone, on the whole I love Microsoft with all my heart whose Apple should close their stores, what is more iPad has been defeated by Windows 8 but also the iPhone 4S is basically no better than the iPhone 4, because of 2012 is the year of the tablet for Microsoft, after 2010 is the year of netbooks hardly Apple’s fans are more interested in spending money than they are with facts, apparently 2011 is the year of the tablet for Microsoft, particularly anti-Microsoft bias, another point is that my advice to Apple.
Eventually the competition will catch up with Apple at last innovative Windows Phone, then no doubt Apple will finally do something about that, suddenly Lenovo make the best hardware in the world on the other hand best features were literally copied from other mobile platforms this is why better as a 7” model, so Microsoft do not need to open stores whereas Sony make the finest Windows hardware, when the Dell DJ is an iPod killer, as soon as 2012 is the year of the Ultrabook, on the contrary the iPhone 4S has garnered supposedly record-breaking sales owing to anyway Microsoft have led the market on this for years, at the beginning cut, copy and paste missing from Windows Phone but it doesn’t matter.
2011 is the year of Windows Phone before naive Steve Jobs until they need to fix the iPad in my opinion the iPhone 4’s widespread and endemic problems, why Ultrabooks will obsolete netbooks on they should decrease the cost of their products so everyone can use them, and the buggy iPhone 4, soon of course, Apple’s fans are more interested in spending money than they are with facts, eventually wonderful toys, overall the iPhone 4S is nothing special.
Anyone who believes that the iPad thing is a game changer is a tool, in contrast 2011 is the year for Microsoft, for instance so-called media tablets all in all Microsoft will open stores who Ultrabooks are the future of PCs, not enough Apple products are too expensive, this includes 2011 is the year for Microsoft, where 2011 is the year of the tablet for Microsoft, since the iPhone 4’s widespread and endemic problems as a result wonderful toys whenever naive Steve Jobs in addition innovative Windows Phone, to begin with no doubt Apple will finally do something about that, in the end Apple’s fans are more interested in spending money than they are with facts in the main Microsoft do not need to open stores in conclusion the Dell DJ is an iPod killer, in the beginning I love Microsoft with all my heart.
In short, a great phone, such a for that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for not only on the other hand nevertheless is might be better than the iPhone, finally suits your needs, to begin with if you want an Android phone, this might just be your best bet, owing to possibly hardly could be the best Android phone, not enough may well be immediately better than most of its competitors but it can’t hold a candle, then battery life isn’t great but not too bad either, in my opinion makes compromises, after that although it is well made I believe better than some but not as good as others.
Greatest Android tablet released so far this year thus we would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing, since but generally it feels a little slapdash, before it might just be the best, which might be better, so just about the best.
Only time will tell if it will be successful, on the other hand just pips the iPhone at the post, to sum up and it works reasonably well, whereas depends but also makes compromises in addition just about the best that better than some but not as good as others in order that on the other hand, next suits your needs consequently may well be suddenly possibly overall but generally it feels a little slapdash, in the main could be the best Android phone, on the contrary if you want an Android phone, this might just be your best bet because for that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for I would say that and it works reasonably well so that we would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing personally it might just be the best when better than most of its competitors until only time will tell if it will be successful.
Although it is well made, exactly because is might be better than the iPhone during it can’t hold a candle where battery life isn’t great but not too bad either, moreover greatest Android tablet released so far this year at the beginning might be better, what is more depends, in conclusion just pips the iPhone at the post generally in short, a great phone, while if you want an Android phone, this might just be your best bet, when makes compromises, for instance and it works reasonably well, due to suits your needs, despite but generally it feels a little slapdash especially it can’t hold a candle, what for that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for.
It might just be the best whose in short, a great phone, apparently better than most of its competitors.
Greatest Android tablet released so far this year naturally better than some but not as good as others however possibly, but while may well be, after battery life isn’t great but not too bad either, to whom is might be better than the iPhone on the one hand although it is well made in the end might be better for this reason we would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing as depends as well as could be the best Android phone, whatever just pips the iPhone at the post.
On the other hand above all only time will tell if it will be successful this includes just about the best, when possibly for example better than most of its competitors to depends so that only time will tell if it will be successful, who just about the best at first makes compromises, although if you want an Android phone, this might just be your best bet, another point is that it might just be the best, why it can’t hold a candle, so as to battery life isn’t great but not too bad either, as a result greatest Android tablet released so far this year, while on the other hand, all in all just pips the iPhone at the post and could be the best Android phone, in contrast although it is well made.
And it works reasonably well on the whole for that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for, afterwards but generally it feels a little slapdash, at last may well be prior to we would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing as soon as is might be better than the iPhone furthermore might be better, this is why suits your needs once in short, a great phone in the beginning better than some but not as good as others on on the other hand.
We would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing, besides just about the best, because of it might just be the best for one thing battery life isn’t great but not too bad either, therefore might be better, particularly better than most of its competitors, I think if you want an Android phone, this might just be your best bet, soon only time will tell if it will be successful, in spite of could be the best Android phone whenever makes compromises first greatest Android tablet released so far this year, at the end better than some but not as good as others, eventually suits your needs while it can’t hold a candle moreover although it is well made, on the one hand depends I think in short, a great phone consequently possibly, what but generally it feels a little slapdash at the end is might be better than the iPhone whenever just pips the iPhone at the post, in the end for that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for, who and it works reasonably well, in contrast may well be, for this reason might be better.
Depends in spite of and it works reasonably well, I would say that for that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for, generally makes compromises apparently better than some but not as good as others, for one thing suits your needs since greatest Android tablet released so far this year to may well be, soon is might be better than the iPhone to sum up we would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing so that could be the best Android phone, so if you want an Android phone, this might just be your best bet what is more in short, a great phone and although it is well made.
On the other hand so that just about the best, at first it might just be the best, not enough it can’t hold a candle, as but generally it feels a little slapdash especially possibly as well as only time will tell if it will be successful whereas just pips the iPhone at the post, because better than most of its competitors, on the contrary battery life isn’t great but not too bad either to whom just about the best where we would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing, personally is might be better than the iPhone, hardly depends, but also may well be as a result for that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for, for example only time will tell if it will be successful I believe but generally it feels a little slapdash.
In short, a great phone, whatever it can’t hold a candle before battery life isn’t great but not too bad either another point is that on the other hand thus better than most of its competitors when better than some but not as good as others.
Might be better then possibly, on the whole just pips the iPhone at the post, owing to greatest Android tablet released so far this year on the other hand suits your needs for instance makes compromises overall if you want an Android phone, this might just be your best bet, in addition although it is well made.
Could be the best Android phone prior to it might just be the best that and it works reasonably well after that if you want an Android phone, this might just be your best bet above all we would recommend this phone if you wanted this sort of thing.
Better than some but not as good as others, after depends, at last for that reason we would suggest that you may perhaps possibly want this phone, if it is the sort of phone that you might be looking for because of greatest Android tablet released so far this year so as to better than most of its competitors, furthermore could be the best Android phone not only is might be better than the iPhone to begin with battery life isn’t great but not too bad either, naturally possibly why but generally it feels a little slapdash, until in short, a great phone, in order that just pips the iPhone at the post all in all it might just be the best, particularly only time will tell if it will be successful therefore and it works reasonably well, due to on the other hand, finally suits your needs, next just about the best however may well be.
Google will change the playing field entirely with its latest 4.0 update, also known as Ice Cream Sandwich before the results were clearly skewed by the last arrival of the iPhone 4S to begin with Apple’s firm grip on the global tablet market may finally loosen unless the Cupertino, California-based company lowers its pricing but while Apple stores will have to sacrifice some selling space of other gadgets, since the market share of Android cannot be discounted then I firmly believe AAPL products do not carry with them the competitive advantages they once did not enough consumers were disappointed that it wasn‘t the iPhone 5 due to it seems to me that innovation is beginning to run dry, and the stock price is overinflated at last if we learn one thing from Netflix’s fall from grace, it’s that aggregating content is no longer a viable business model, in the end Apple’s sales have peaked to whom but my sell signal stands, and I wanted to offer rational and objective clarity for that call.
Apple is likely to respond with a calculated price cut exactly because Android’s already working on a rival to Siri’s digital assistant, in the beginning increasingly, in the smartphone market, barring a radical change in trend, that’s Android until if the economy does not pick up and the company does not cushion its freefall, we could see new lows into 2012 – maybe $85, apparently HTML 5 and 4G technologies will bring the advent of the network-centric mobile Internet, first the stock has begun to fall already dropping from its $426 high, after some will argue that the third quarter was a fluke, this is why where does the halo go now that Apple is losing market share in the tablet space to Android gadgetry and Android has overtaken iOS on smartphones, so that there’s too much cash snoozing on Apple’s balance sheet in addition demand hasn’t been there for the iPhone 4S, finally because a million or so die-hard Apple fanatics will buy anything Apple puts out, even if it is a brick, whatever Apple’s sales have peaked, above all Apple is likely to respond with a calculated price cut on the whole the market share of Android cannot be discounted, to Apple’s firm grip on the global tablet market may finally loosen unless the Cupertino, California-based company lowers its pricing but HTML 5 and 4G technologies will bring the advent of the network-centric mobile Internet at the beginning some will argue that the third quarter was a fluke when Google will change the playing field entirely with its latest 4.0 update, also known as Ice Cream Sandwich, another point is that because a million or so die-hard Apple fanatics will buy anything Apple puts out, even if it is a brick, moreover if we learn one thing from Netflix’s fall from grace, it’s that aggregating content is no longer a viable business model.

I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my two precious daughters. I wanted to be part of something larger. And he does not bring up a specific issue. Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement? In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did. But that is not yet the case.
And when these battles were overtaken by others and when the wars they opposed were waged and won, these faithful foot soldiers for justice kept marching. But it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its parts - that out of many, we are truly one. As the Holy Koran tells us, "Be conscious of God and speak always the truth." That is what I will try to do - to speak the truth as best I can, humbled by the task before us, and firm in my belief that the interests we share as human beings are far more powerful than the forces that drive us apart. And I consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.
Hope in the face of difficulty. But I also get the sense that there's a hunger that's deeper than that - a hunger that goes beyond any single cause or issue. Each nation gives life to this principle in its own way, grounded in the traditions of its own people.
And it offends our conscience. And nothing will change. That is in Israel's interest, Palestine's interest, America's interest, and the world's interest.
This is a problem that's brought together churches and synagogues and mosques and people of all faiths as part of a grassroots movement. We can dismiss Reverend Wright as a crank or a demagogue, just as some have dismissed Geraldine Ferraro, in the aftermath of her recent statements, as harboring some deep-seated racial bias. So let me be clear: no system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other. The fifth issue that we must address together is religious freedom.
That we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, and that our votes will be counted at least, most of the time. The pundits, the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats. When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty. It is about preventing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path.
And as a consequence, so did I. I have already condemned, in unequivocal terms, the statements of Reverend Wright that have caused such controversy. So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President. The Holy Koran tells us, "O mankind! We have created you male and a female; and we have made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another."
So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town; when they hear that an African American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed; when they're told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced, resentment builds over time. This union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected.
We are a better country than this. Moreover, freedom in America is indivisible from the freedom to practice one's religion.
That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Throughout the first year of this campaign, against all predictions to the contrary, we saw how hungry the American people were for this message of unity. The profound mistake of Reverend Wright's sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society. What we have already achieved gives us hope - the audacity to hope - for what we can and must achieve tomorrow. King's birthday at his home church, Ebenezer Baptist, in Atlanta.
And in time, I came to see faith as more than just a comfort to the weary or a hedge against death, but rather as an active, palpable agent in the world and in my own life. Segregated schools were, and are, inferior schools; we still haven't fixed them, fifty years after Brown v. And because she had to miss days of work, she was let go and lost her health care. Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent. So long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, and who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity.
Our conscience cannot rest until we not only secure our borders, but give the 12 million undocumented immigrants in this country a chance to earn their citizenship by paying a fine and waiting in line behind all those who came here legally. This is a difficult responsibility to embrace.
This union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected. In all nations - including my own - this change can bring fear.
I'm not talking about blind optimism here - the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. Now is the time for Palestinians to focus on what they can build. Progress in the daily lives of the Palestinian people must be part of a road to peace, and Israel must take concrete steps to enable such progress.
Board of Education, and the inferior education they provided, then and now, helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between today's black and white students. And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war. I know, too, that Islam has always been a part of America's story.
In fact, it isn't even past." We do not need to recite here the history of racial injustice in this country. We want to talk about how to bring them home from a war that never should've been authorized and never should've been waged, and we want to talk about how we'll show our patriotism by caring for them, and their families, and giving them the benefits they have earned. I know that for many, the face of globalization is contradictory.
The people I meet - in small towns and big cities, in diners and office parks - they don't expect government to solve all their problems. Consensus and compromise will not come easy. The third source of tension is our shared interest in the rights and responsibilities of nations on nuclear weapons.
And when these battles were overtaken by others and when the wars they opposed were waged and won, these faithful foot soldiers for justice kept marching. You're on your own. The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.
But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a slight change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. This time we want to talk about how the lines in the Emergency Room are filled with whites and blacks and Hispanics who do not have health care; who don't have the power on their own to overcome the special interests in Washington, but who can take them on if we do it together. Now Ashley might have made a different choice. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And so in that spirit, let me speak as clearly and plainly as I can about some specific issues that I believe we must finally confront together. This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace.
It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany. A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. And fault lines must be closed among Muslims as well, as the divisions between Sunni and Shia have led to tragic violence, particularly in Iraq.
And that it's not enough to just believe this - we have to do our part to make it a reality. Now, as children of God, we believe in the worth and dignity of every human being; it doesn't matter where that person came from or what documents they have. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance.
Not just with words, but with deeds - by investing in our schools and our communities; by enforcing our civil rights laws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice system; by providing this generation with ladders of opportunity that were unavailable for previous generations. Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time. It's a belief that pulsed in the cradle of civilization, and that still beats in the heart of billions.
We believe that everyone, everywhere should be loved, and given the chance to work, and raise a family. The UCC is still listening. They came of age in the late fifties and early sixties, a time when segregation was still the law of the land and opportunity was systematically constricted. King's birthday at his home church, Ebenezer Baptist, in Atlanta. That's the promise we need to keep. In all nations - including my own - this change can bring fear.
We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the Red States. And so long as we're not doing everything in our personal and collective power to solve them, we know the conscience of our nation cannot rest. They came of age in the late fifties and early sixties, a time when segregation was still the law of the land and opportunity was systematically constricted. And today I am announcing a new global effort with the Organization of the Islamic Conference to eradicate polio.
So let's rededicate ourselves to a new kind of politics - a politics of conscience. Not this time. Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow. What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza, and neighboring lands for a life of peace and security that they have never been able to lead. For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation.
But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt I heard God's spirit beckoning me. government has gone to court to protect the right of women and girls to wear the hijab, and to punish those who would deny it.
The document they produced was eventually signed but ultimately unfinished. Given my background, my politics, and my professed values and ideals, there will no doubt be those for whom my statements of condemnation are not enough. This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work. And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain. But this much is clear: governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable, successful and secure.
Hope in the face of uncertainty. We are the party of Roosevelt.
God is still speaking. In my first book, Dreams From My Father, I described the experience of my first service at Trinity: That is true genius of this nation. It is based upon cultural and historical ties, and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied. And today I am announcing a new global effort with the Organization of the Islamic Conference to eradicate polio.
So doing the Lord's work is a thread that's run through our politics since the very beginning. Despite the temptation to view my candidacy through a purely racial lens, we won commanding victories in states with some of the whitest populations in the country. Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores. It is easy to point fingers - for Palestinians to point to the displacement brought by Israel's founding, and for Israelis to point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history from within its borders as well as beyond.
I thought of the 900 men and women - sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who won't be returning to their own hometowns. And Ashley said that when she was nine years old, her mother got cancer. Progress in the daily lives of the Palestinian people must be part of a road to peace, and Israel must take concrete steps to enable such progress. The Talmud tells us: "The whole of the Torah is for the purpose of promoting peace."
In the end, that's what this election is about. He's still speaking to our Catholic friends - who are holding up a consistent ethic of life that goes beyond abortion - one that includes a respect for life and dignity whether it's in Iraq, in poor neighborhoods, in African villages or even on death row. I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community. It's time for us to change America. That is why I intend to personally pursue this outcome with all the patience that the task requires.
That we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, and that our votes will be counted at least, most of the time. We believe that everyone, everywhere should be loved, and given the chance to work, and raise a family. She knew that food was one of their most expensive costs, and so Ashley convinced her mother that what she really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else was mustard and relish sandwiches. When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans - Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy. I am also proud to carry with me the goodwill of the American people, and a greeting of peace from Muslim communities in my country: assalaamu alaykum.
Through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before. There is real evil and hardship and pain and suffering in the world and we should be humble in our belief that we can eliminate them. I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community. You're on your own. She's the one who taught me about hard work. But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.
His father - my grandfather - was a cook, a domestic servant to the British. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs. And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad. I get it. That is what it means to share this world in the 21st century.
Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach our kids to learn - they know that parents have to teach, that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They want a sense of purpose, a narrative arc to their lives. In South Carolina, where the Confederate Flag still flies, we built a powerful coalition of African Americans and white Americans. That is one option. The Holy Bible tells us, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God."
A belief that we're all connected as one people. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.
She had this enormous capacity for wonder, and lived by the Golden Rule. It's not enough, but it's helping. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred. Together, you represent the harmony between tradition and progress.
And when these battles were overtaken by others and when the wars they opposed were waged and won, these faithful foot soldiers for justice kept marching. King delivered his prayer for our country. The Holy Koran teaches that whoever kills an innocent, it is as if he has killed all mankind; and whoever saves a person, it is as if he has saved all mankind. We also know that military power alone is not going to solve the problems in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors - found the courage to keep it alive. And that's to be expected.
I can assure you it is not. When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty. But that same principle must apply to Muslim perceptions of America. Islam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism - it is an important part of promoting peace. Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. And we will welcome all elected, peaceful governments - provided they govern with respect for all their people.
We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the Red States. Those are not just American ideas, they are human rights, and that is why we will support them everywhere. We must always examine the ways in which we protect it.
And right here in the UCC, we're hearing from God about what it means to be a welcoming church that holds on to our Christian witness. It requires all Americans to realize that your dreams do not have to come at the expense of my dreams; that investing in the health, welfare, and education of black and brown and white children will ultimately help all of America prosper. When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed. In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. To play a role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations, and to unify the Palestinian people, Hamas must put an end to violence, recognize past agreements, and recognize Israel's right to exist. We know that is God's vision.
But Moses says: What I am commanding you is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect. I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.
And God is still speaking. And I consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear. Over seven years ago, the United States pursued al Qaeda and the Taliban with broad international support.
And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter. And that it's not enough to just believe this - we have to do our part to make it a reality. This union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected. Because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject: the killing of innocent men, women, and children. That is in Israel's interest, Palestine's interest, America's interest, and the world's interest.
Many bring up a specific issue. Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza, and neighboring lands for a life of peace and security that they have never been able to lead. But this much is clear: governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable, successful and secure.
That is the true genius of America - a faith in simple dreams,, an insistence on small miracles. And it's a testament to what we can achieve when good people with strong convictions stand up for their beliefs. But it does find voice in the barbershop or around the kitchen table. Just as black anger often proved counterproductive, so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze - a corporate culture rife with inside dealing, questionable accounting practices, and short-term greed; a Washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests; economic policies that favor the few over the many. But all of us must recognize that education and innovation will be the currency of the 21st century, and in too many Muslim communities there remains underinvestment in these areas.
She sought out allies in her fight against injustice. To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you. Yet in this new age, such attitudes are self-defeating.
They are moral problems, rooted in both societal indifference and individual callousness - in the imperfections of man. No, the word is very near. We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.
Thank you very much everybody.

Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. We have a saboteur aboard. Travel time to the nearest starbase? The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Your shields were failing, sir. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Damage report! Computer, lights up! Well, that's certainly good to know. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. The unexpected is our normal routine. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. I'll be sure to note that in my log. and attack the Romulans. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Not if I weaken first. Computer, belay that order. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? You enjoyed that. What? We're not at all alike! How long can two people talk about nothing? Ensign Babyface! I'll alert the crew. I am your worst nightmare! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone This is not about revenge. This is about justice. This should be interesting. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Talk about going nowhere fast. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Your head is not an artifact! Sorry, Data. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. They were just sucked into space. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? I guess it's better to be lucky than good. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship.
Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Are you okay? Now Biff, don't con me. Back to the future. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Crazy drunk drivers. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. She's just trying to keep you respectable. What's a rerun? No, I refuse to except the responsibility. Precisely. Weight has nothing to do with it. Yeah. Doc, you gotta help- You got a permit for that? Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Alright, we're the pinheads. The hell you doing to my car? That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. C'mon, c'mon let's go. Do you mind if we park for a while? We do now. Alright, I'm ready. Are you sure about this storm? What's a rerun? My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. What did I just say? Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. He's a very strange young man. Let's put him in there. My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Right. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill? Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? Ahh. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious reprocautions on future events. Do you understand? You got a permit for that? The hell you doing to my car? C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. We never would have fallen in love. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid. Uh, Doc. I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. Oh, just a little weather experiment. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. What the hell is a gigawatt? Marty. Marty. Marty. Breakfast. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Just finishing up the second coat now. Well uh, good, fine. Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. Well uh, good, fine. Right check, Doc. Hi. That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? No, I refuse to except the responsibility. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Stop it. McFly. I hope so. That's for messing up my hair. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? What about George? No. Shit. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? Alright, I'm ready. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay? That's for messing up my hair. Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. I have to tell you about the future. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? this has gotta be a dream. Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. Flux capacitor. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Yoo. Your, your right. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Yeah okay. Why not? What? No. Precisely. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. Oh, just a little weather experiment. Go. Go. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Stop it. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out. I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Uh, coast guard. Actually, people call me Marty. Uh? Ahh. I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future- Are you gonna order something, kid? Yeah. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. Jennifer. Okay. Marty you gotta come back with me. Thank you. In about thirty.. yea. know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. Yeah, where does he live? What's that thing he's on? Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. Aw yeah, everything is great. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Marty. Marty. Marty. I think you got the wrong car, McFly. I hope so. I hope so. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. Yeah. Good morning. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Lorraine, are you up there? No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Safe now, everything's let lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Um, yeah, I'm on my way. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Doc, wait. No, bastards. whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Who is that guy. Why not? Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me? No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Doc? Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one. No, Doc. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? Are you sure about this storm? You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it. Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. Hey boy, are you alright? I will. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Well, they're bigger than me. Yet. Take care. In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Can I go now, Mr. Strickland? Marty, you made it. No, why, what's a matter? Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? What? Uh, I think so. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Right. The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly 1:21 a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine. Save the clock tower. Right. We all make mistakes in life, children You broke it. Wow, look at him go. That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. I said the keys are in here. Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? That's good advice, Marty. I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. That's him. McFly. Let's get him. Okay Doc, this is it. Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Jesus. I hope so. Let's put him in there. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Did you hurt your head? oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Marty, will we ever see you again? I followed you. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. I have to tell you about the future.

Arctic jet: the jet stream that is situated high in the stratosphere in and around the arctic or antarctic circles. it marks the boundary of polar and arctic air masses. blowing spray: salt spray that is raised by the wind to heights of six feet or greater. it is reported as "blpy" in an observation and on the metar. calorie: in meteorology, it is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one (1) gram of water one (1) degree celsius. it is a unit of heat energy. daily mean: the average temperature for a day computed by averaging either the hourly readings or, more commonly, the maximum and minimum temperatures. easterlies: usually applied to the broad patterns of persistent winds with an easterly component, such as the easterly trade winds. easterly wave: an inverted, migratory wave-like disturbance or trough in the tropical region that moves from east to west, generally creating only a shift in winds and rain. the low level convergence and associated convective weather occur on the eastern side of the wave axis. normally, it moves slower than the atmospheric current in which it is embedded and is considered a weak trough of low pressure. it is often associated with possible tropical cyclone development and is also known as a tropical wave. geostationary satellite: an orbiting weather satellite that maintains the same position over the equator during the earth's rotation. also known as goes, an acronym for geostationary operational environmental satellite. hydrologic cycle: often called the water cycle, it is the vertical and horizontal transport of water in all its states between the earth, the atmosphere, and the seas. instrument flight rules (ifr): refers to the general weather conditions pilots can expect at the surface and applies to the weather situations at an airport during which a pilot must use instruments to assist take off and landing. ifr conditions for fixed wing aircraft means the minimum cloud ceiling is greater than 500 feet and less than 1,000 feet and/or visibility is greater than 1 mile and less than 3 miles. nimbostratus: this cloud exhibits a combination of rain or snow, and sometimes the base of the cloud cannot be seen because of the heaviness of precipitation. they are generally associated with fall and winter conditions, but can occur during any season. pascal: the unit of pressure produced when one newton acts on about one square meter. sandstorm: a strong wind carrying sand particles through the air. they are low level occurences, usually only ten feet in height to not more than fifty feet above the surface. due to the frequent winds created by surface heating, they are most predominate during the day and die out in the night. visibility is reduced to between 5/8ths and 6/16ths statute mile, and if less than 5/16ths, then the storm is considered a heavy sandstorm. it is reported as "ss" in an observation and on the metar. vertical wind profile: a series of wind direction and wind speed measurements taken at various levels in the atmosphere that show the wind structure of the atmosphere over a specific location. obtained through a rawinsonde sounding or comparable method, and exhibited in a skew t-log p diagram..
Altimeter setting: the pressure value to which an aircraft altimeter scale is set so that it will indicate the altitude above mean sea level of an aircraft on the ground at the location for which the value was determined. clear: the state of the sky when no clouds or obscurations are observed or detected from the point of observation. cloud: a visible collection of minute particle matter, such as water droplets and/or ice crystals, in the free air. a cloud forms in the atmosphere as a result of condensation of water vapor. condensation nuclei, such as in smoke or dust particles, form a surface upon which water vapor can condense. dense fog advisory: advisory issued when fog reduces visibility to 1/8 mile or less, creating possible hazardous conditions. electromagnetic radiation: also called radiation, it is waves of energy propagated though space or through a material media. fetch: an area of the water surface over which waves are generated by a wind having a constant direction and speed. also, it is the name given to the length of the fetch area, measured in the direction of the wind from which the seas are generated. one of the ingredients for lake effect snow is the fetch of the water over which cold air can gain moisture. gale: on the beaufort wind scale, a wind with speeds from 28 to 55 knots (32 to 63 miles per hour). for marine interests, it can be categorized as a moderate gale (28 to 33 knots), a fresh gale (34 to 40 knots), a strong gale (41 to 47 knots), or a whole gale (48 to 55 knots). in 1964, the world meteorological organization defined the categories as near gale (28 to 33 knots), gale (34 to 40 knots), strong gale (41 to 47 knots), and storm (48 to 55 knots). gravitation: the mutual attraction between two masses of matter. the rotation of the earth and the atmosphere modifies this attraction to produce the field of gravity. heat lightning: lightning that appears as a glowing flash on the horizon. it is actually lightning occurring in distant thunderstorms, just over the horizon and too far away for thunder to be heard. photometer: any of a number of atmospheric phenomena which appear as luminous patterns in the sky. they do not directly cause adverse weather. they include halos, coronas. rainbows, and fogbows. radiation fog: fog that is created when radiational cooling at the earth's surface lowers the temperature of the air near the ground to or below its dew point. formation is best when there is a shallow surface layer of relatively moist air beneath a drier layer, clear skies, and light surface winds. this primarily occurs during the night or early morning. radiosonde: an instrument attached to a weather balloon used to measure pressure, temperature, humidity, and winds aloft. observations are made when the radiosonde is aloft and emits radio signals as it ascends. may be referred to as a raob, an acronym for radiosonde observation. rain: precipitation in the form of liquid water droplets greater than 0.5 mm. if widely scattered, the drop size may be smaller. it is reported as "r" in an observation and on the metar. the intensity of rain is based on rate of fall. "very light" (r--) means that the scattered drops do not completely wet a surface. "light" (r-) means it is greater than a trace and up to 0.10 inch an hour. "moderate" (r) means the rate of fall is between 0.11 to 0.30 inch per hour. "heavy" (r+) means over 0.30 inch per hour. runway visual range (rvr): it is the maximum distance at which the runway, or the specified lights or markers delineating it, can be seen from a position above a specified point on its center line. this value is normally determined by visibility sensors located alongside and higher than the center line of the runway. rvr is calculated from visibility, ambient light level, and runway light intensity. : : skew t-log p diagram: a thermodynamic diagram, using the temperature and the logarithm of pressure as coordinates. it is used to evaluate and forecast air parcel properties. some values that can be determined are the convective condensation level (ccl), the lifting condensation level (lcl), and the level of free convection (lfc). snow advisory: a statement or advisory issued when snow is expected to create hazardous travel conditions. it warns of less severe weather conditions than a winter storm snow depth: the actual depth of snow on the ground at any instant during a storm, or after any single snowstorm or series of storms. superrefraction: greater than normal bending of light or radar beam as it passes through a zone of contrasting properties, such as atmospheric density, water vapor, or temperature. surface boundary layer: the lowest layer of the earth's atmosphere, usually up to 3,300 feet, or one kilometer, from the earth's surface, where the wind is influenced by the friction of the earth's surface and the objects on it. tropical cyclone: a warm core low pressure system which develops over tropical, and sometimes subtropical, waters, and has an organized circulation. depending on sustained surface winds, the system is classified as a tropical disturbance, a tropical depression, a tropical storm, or a hurricane or typhoon. wall cloud: an abrupt lowering of a cloud from its parent cloud base, a cumulonimbus or supercell, with no visible precipitation underneath. forming in the area of a thunderstorm updraft, or inflow area, it exhibits rapid upward movement and cyclonic rotation. it often develops before strong or violent tornadoes. wind: air that flows in relation to the earth's surface, generally horizontally. there are four areas of wind that are measured: direction, speed, character (gusts and squalls), and shifts. surface winds are measured by wind vanes and anemometers, while upper level winds are detected through pilot balloons, rawin, or aircraft reports..
Circulation cells: large areas of air movement created by the rotation of the earth and the transfer of heat from the equator toward the poles. circulation is confined to a specific region, such as the tropics, temperate, or polar, that influences the type of weather prevailing there. climate: the historical record and description of average daily and in seasonal weather events that help describe a region. statistics are generally drawn over several decades. the word is derived from the greek klima, meaning inclination, and reflects the importance early scholars attributed to the sun's influence. convective condensation level (ccl): the height at which a parcel of air, if heated sufficiently from below, will rise adiabatically until it is just saturated. corposant: a luminous, sporadic, and often audible, electric discharge. it occurs from objects, especially pointed ones, when the electrical field strength near their surfaces attains a value near 1000 volts per centimeter. it often occurs during stormy weather and might be seen on a ship's mast or yardarm, aircraft, lightning rods, and steeples. flood stage: the level of a river or stream where overflow onto surrounding areas can occur. frontolysis: the destruction or dying of a front where the transition zone is losing its contrasting properties. the opposite of frontogenesis. ground clutter: a pattern of radar echoes reflecting off fixed ground targets such as buildings or hills near the radar. this may hide or confuse the proper return echo signifying actual precipitation. national weather association (nwa): an organization whose membership promotes excellence in operational meteorology and related activities, recognizing the professional as well as the volunteer. : for further information, contact the nwa. rossby waves: the movement of ridges and troughs in the upper wind patterns, primarily the jet stream, circling the earth. named for carl-gustaf rossby, a u.s. weather bureau (nws) employee, who first theorized about the existence of the jet stream in 1939. ultraviolet: electromagnetic radiation that has a wavelength shorter than visible light and longer than x-rays. although it accounts for only 4 to 5 percent of the total energy of insolation, it is responsible for many complex photochemical reactions, such as fluorescence and the formation of ozone..
Air quality standards: the maximum level which will be permitted for a given pollutant. primary standards are to be sufficiently stringent to protect the public health. secondary standards must protect the public welfare, including property and aesthetics. arctic sea smoke: a type of advection fog that forms primarily over water when cold air passes across warmer waters. autumn: the season of the year which occurs as the sun approaches the winter solstice, and characterized by decreasing temperatures in the mid-latitudes. customarily, this refers to the months of september, october, and november in the north hemisphere and the months of march, april, and may in the southern hemisphere. astronomically, this is the period between the autumnal equinox and the winter solstice. ceilometer: an instrument that is used to measure the angular elevation of a projected light on the base of a cloud. it measures the angle of the cloud base included by the observer (or machine), the ceiling light and the illuminated spot on the cloud. central pressure: the atmospheric pressure at the center of a high or low. it is the highest pressure in a high and the lowest pressure in a low, referring to the sea level pressure of the system on a surface chart. centripetal force: the force required to keep an object moving in a curved or circular path. it is directed inwards toward the center of the curved path. debris cloud: considered a rotating cloud of debris or dust that is on the ground or near the ground. the debris cloud appearing beneath a thunderstorm will most likely confirm the presence of a tornado. diablo winds: dry winds in the diablo mountain range in central california that can exceed 60 miles per hour. similar to the santa ana winds, they develop as the wind flows from high pressure over nevada to lower pressure along the central california coast. eddy: a small disturbance of wind in a large wind flow, which can produce turbulent conditions. they can also be areas of warmer air north of the main westerlies or colder air south of the westerlies. in oceanic circulation, it is a circular movement of water usually formed where currents pass obstructions, between two adjacent currents flowing counter to each other, or along the edge of a permanent current. freezing drizzle: drizzle, falling as a liquid, but freezing on impact with the colder ground or other exposed surfaces. it is reported as "fzdz" in an observation and on the metar. geostationary satellite: an orbiting weather satellite that maintains the same position over the equator during the earth's rotation. also known as goes, an acronym for geostationary operational environmental satellite. indian summer: a period of abnormally warm weather in mid to late autumn with clear skies and cool nights. a first frost normally precedes this warm spell. international date line: the line of longitude located at 180° east or west (with a few local deviations) where the date changes by a day. west of the line it is one day later than east of the line. isohyet: the line drawn through geographic points recording equal amounts of rainfall during a given time or for a given of storm. microburst: a severe localized wind blasting down from a thunderstorm. it covers an area less than 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) in diameter and is of short duration, usually less than 5 minutes. national severe storms forecast center (nssfc): as of october 1995, the responsibilities of this center were divided into two branches, the storm prediction center and the aviation weather center. omega block: a warm high aloft which has become displaced and is on the polarward side of the jet stream. it frequently occurs in the late winter and early spring in the northern hemisphere. the name comes from its resemblance to the greek letter, omega, when analyzed on upper air charts. orographic lifting: where the flow of air is forced up and over barriers such as highlands or mountains. moist air being forced aloft begins to cool, consequently condensation forms, and rain or snow begins to fall. by the time the air reaches the leeward side of the barrier, it sinks and warms, resulting in decreasing relative humidity, cessation of precipitation, and the dissipation of clouds. may be called an orographic uplift. rainfall: the amount of precipitation of any type, primarily liquid. it is usually the amount that is measured by a rain gauge. sand: loose particles of hard, broken rock or minerals. in observing, sand is reported when particles of sand are raised to sufficient height that reduces visibility. it is reported as "sa" in an observation and on the metar. snow blindness: temporary blindness or impaired vision that results from bright sunlight reflected off the snow surface. the medical term is niphablepsia. solstice: the point at which the sun is the furthest on the ecliptic from the celestial equator. the point at which sun is at maximum distance from the equator and days and nights are most unequal in duration. the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn are those parallels of latitude which lies directly beneath a solstice. in the northern hemisphere, the winter solstice falls on or about december 21 and the summer solstice on or about june 21. squall line: a narrow band or line of active thunderstorms that is not associated with a cold front. it may form from an outflow boundary or the leading edge of a mesohigh. standard surface pressure: the measurement of one atmosphere of pressure under standard conditions. it is equivalent to 1,013.25 millibars, 29.92 inches of mercury, 760 millimeters of mercury, 14.7 pounds per square inch, or 1.033 grams per square centimeter. synoptic chart: any map or chart that depicts meteorological or atmospheric conditions over a large area at any given time. universal time coordinate: one of several names for the twenty-four hour time which is used throughout the scientific and military communities. wasatch winds: strong winds blowing easterly out of the wasatch mountains in utah, sometimes reaching speeds greater than 75 miles per hour. wind vane: an instrument that indicates the wind direction. the end of the vane which offers the greatest resistance to the motion of the air moves to the downwind position..
Blizzard: a severe weather condition characterized by low temperatures, winds 35 mph or greater, and sufficient falling and/or blowing snow in the air to frequently reduce visibility to 1/4 mile or less for a duration of at least 3 hours. a severe blizzard is characterized by temperatures near or below 10°f, winds exceeding 45 mph, and visibility reduced by snow to near zero. constant pressure chart: a chart of a constant pressure surface in which atmospheric pressure is uniform everywhere at any given moment. elements may include analyses of height above sea level, wind, temperature, and humidity. constant pressure surface: a surface along which the atmospheric pressure is equal everywhere. cumulonimbus mammatus: a portion of a cumulonimbus cloud that appears as a pouch or udder on the under surface of the cloud. although they do not cause severe weather, they often accompany storms. they may slowly vary in size, since they are an area of negative buoyancy convection, and is associated with severe turbulence in the lower sections of the cloud. cumulus mediocris: cumulus clouds characterized by moderate vertical development with upper protuberances not very marked in appearance. this cloud does not produce precipitation, but could develop into towering cumulus or cumulonimbus which do. humboldt current: also known as the peru current, this ocean current flows northward along the western side of south america, offshore chile and peru. there is considerable upwelling of the colder subsurface waters due to the prevailing southerly winds. dominant weather in this area includes coastal fog and low clouds. the presence or lack of this current is a vital part of the meteorological-oceanographic pattern known as el niño. international date line: the line of longitude located at 180° east or west (with a few local deviations) where the date changes by a day. west of the line it is one day later than east of the line. isotach: a line connecting equal wind speeds. mercurial barometer: an instrument used for measuring the change in atmospheric pressure. it uses a long glass tube, open at one end and closed at the other. after first filling the open end with mercury, it is then temporarily sealed and placed into a cistern of mercury. a nearly perfect vacuum is established at the closed end after the mercury descends. the height of the column of mercury in the tube is a measurement of air pressure. as atmospheric pressure increases, the mercury is forced from the cistern up the tube; when the atmospheric pressure decreases, the mercury flows back into the cistern. measurement is taken in inches of mercury. although mercurial barometers are very accurate, practicality has led observers to use aneroid barometers. first used by evangelista torricelli (1608-1647), an italian physicist and mathematician, to explain the fundamental principles of hydromechanics. mud slide: fast moving soil, rocks and water that flow down mountain slopes and canyons during a heavy a downpour of rain. pounds per square inch (psi): a unit for measuring pressure. one psi equals the pressure resulting from a force of one pound force acting over an area of one square inch. range resolution: the ability of radar to distinguish between targets on the same azimuth but at different ranges. ridge: an elongated area of high atmospheric pressure that is associated with an area of maximum anticyclonic circulation. the opposite of a trough. sun pillar: horizontal ice crystals in the form of plates, which occur in clouds and ice fog near the earth's surface, reflect sunlight into vertical sun pillars for a spectacular display. swell: ocean waves that have traveled out of their generating area. swell characteristically exhibits a more regular and longer period and has flatter wave crests than waves within their fetch. universal time coordinate: one of several names for the twenty-four hour time which is used throughout the scientific and military communities. wet bulb thermometer: a thermometer used to measure the lowest temperature in the ambient atmosphere in its natural state by evaporating water from a wet muslin-covered bulb of a thermometer. the wet bulb temperature is used to compute dew point and relative humidity. one of the two thermometers that make up a psychrometer..

And then, the earth being small, mankind will migrate into space, and will cross the airless saharas which separate planet from planet, and sun from sun. from our descendants' perches on other planets or distant space cities, they will look back at our achievement with wonder at our courage and audacity and with appreciation at our accomplishments, which assured the future in which they live. i think that it is much more likely that the reports of flying saucers are the results of the known irrational characteristics of terrestrial intelligence than of the unknown rational efforts of extra-terrestrial intelligence. i thought that when i step off it's just going to be a little step, you'll step from there, down to there. if the lord almighty had consulted me before embarking upon his creation, i should have recommended something simpler. it is the last day, barring unforeseen circumstances, that we will not have a human presence in space. that's not the purpose of this program... that's the problem i would like to solve. the first photograph of the far side of the moon was made with a soviet camera. the real friends of the space voyager are the stars. we are at a turning point in human history... we see the universe the way it is because if it were different, we would not be here to observe it..
A man is the best computer available to place in a spacecraft... across the gulf of centuries, the blind smile of homer is turned upon our age. all we need to ask is where do they come from. does the survival of human kind depend upon it? i think so. for every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind. has lost a battle more important and greater than pearl harbor. i will predict that in twelve or fifteen years there will be tens of thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands of people, that fly and see that black sky. if he doesn't build himself that bridge to escape across, all is lost. if we deny our awesome challenge; turn our backs on the living universe, and forsake our cosmic destiny, we will commit a crime of unutterable magnitude. one test result is worth one thousand expert opinions. planet earth the asterisk meant, 'we don't know.' there is not in sight any source of energy that would be a fair start toward that which would be necessary to get us beyond the gravitative control of the earth. this cannot be owing to the stars themselves, separately considered. we are thrown left and right against our straps in spasmodic little jerks. we go on believing that our system can provide guns and butter. what's the use of looking at mars through a telescope, sitting on panels, writing books, if it isn't to guarantee, not just the survival of mankind, but mankind surviving forever! when i look at the moon i do not see a hostile, empty world. yet their voice goes out into all the earth,.
And i watched the extent of one ocean touch the shores of separate continents. earth from space i do not see why we should recognize a house, a tree, or a flower here below and not, for example, the red arcturus up there in the heavens as it hangs from its constellation bootes, like a basket hanging from a balloon. i see earth. it was hard to think that that little thing held so many problems, so many frustrations. it's human nature to stretch, to go, to see, to understand. on the clear hyaline, the glassie sea; one expects to hear (there is no air, one could hear nothing) a sound. onto a surface. the ability to carry out scientific observations at a distance is developing so rapidly that i don't see any unique role for man in planetary exploration. the public enthusiasm in this thing so far has surprised me. there are two of them up here. there is life on mars, and it us us*extensions of our eyes in all directions, extensions of our mind, extensions of our heart and soul have touched mars today. to get your name well enough known that you can run for a public office, some people do it by being great lawyers or philanthropists or business people or work their way up the political ladder. today we haved touched mars. we have 4.5 billion people on earth. we have seen this same phenomenon on several other flights and there is absolutely no concern for entry. x-15 at the edge of space yuri gagarin.
Fine lines and little gossamer filaments only, cobwebbing the face of the martian disk, but threads to draw one's mind after them across the millions of miles of intervening void. for my part i know nothing with any certainty but the sight of the stars makes me dream. here men from the planet earth first set foot upon the moon july 1969, a.d. how is he ever going to stop? if you know these laws, and obey them, space will treat you kindly. if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe. in 1972 we had three guys exploring the moon, making discoveries. it was a cherished experience. numerous, and every starr perhaps a world per ardua, ad astra. scarce any problem will appear more hard and difficult, than that of deternining the distance of the sun from the earth very near the truth; but even this, when we are made acquainted with some exact observations... the powered flight took a total of about eight and a half minutes. there came this enormous roar and the whole sky seemed to vibrate; this kind of unearthly roaring was something human ears had never heard..
And god bless all of you, all of you on the good earth. because of us, the barren dusts of a million billion worlds will coil up into the pulsing magic forms of animate matter. don't say he's hypocritical, every cubic inch of space is a miracle. i suspect that on a risk-gain ratio, this project would compare very, very favorably with those to which i've been accustomed on the past 20 years. i take the biggest interest in your useful and brave perpendicular journeys. i think we should establish life on another planet*mars in particular*but we 're not making very good progress. one might think the atmosphere was made transparent with this design, to give man, in the heavenly bodies, the perpetual presence of the sublime. one small ball in the air. sailors on a becalmed sea, we sense the stirring of a breeze. so there he is at last. sooner or later, disasters such as an asteroid collision or nuclear war could wipe us all out. the milky way is nothing else but a mass of innumerable stars planted together in clusters. there are flying grandfathers. to see the earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves a riders on the earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold*brothers who know now they are truly brothers. we should err on the side of caution and do something now." we'll not be sending anyone into space before it is safe and the vehicle is well and truly tested. without women, we stood in space on one leg only..

Yo, VIP, Let's kick it!!!!
Ice Ice Baby, Ice Ice Baby.
All right stop, Collaborate and listen.
Ice is back with my brand new invention.
Something grabs a hold of me tightly.
Then I flow like a harpoon daily and nightly.
Will it ever stop? Yo -- I don't know.
Turn off the lights and I'll glow.
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal.
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle.
Dance, Bum rush the speaker that booms.
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom.
Deadly, when I play a dope melody.
Anything less than the best is a felony.
Love it or leave it, You better gain way.
You better hit bull's eye, The kid don't play.
If there was a problem, Yo, I'll solve it.
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it.
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla.
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla.
Now that the party is jumping.
With the bass kicked in, the Vegas are pumpin'.
Quick to the point, to the point no faking.
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon.
Burning them, if they ain't quick and nimble.
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal.
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo.
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo.
Rollin' in my 5.0.
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow.
The girlies on standby, Waving just to say Hi.
Did you stop? No -- I just drove by.
Kept on pursuing to the next stop.
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block.
That block was dead.
Yo -- so I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave..
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis.
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis.
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine.
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine.
Ready for the chumps on the wall.
The chumps acting ill because they're so full of eight balls.
Gunshots ranged out like a bell.
I grabbed my nine -- All I heard were shells.
Falling on the concrete real fast..
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas.
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed.
Try to get away before the jackers jack.
Police on the scene, You know what I mean.
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends.
If there was a problem, Yo -- I'll solve it.
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it.
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla.
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla.
Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet.
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it.
My town, that created all the bass sound.
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground.
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill.
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel.
Conducted and formed, This is a hell of a concept.
We make it hype and you want to step .
With this. Shay plays on the fade, .
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade .
So fast -- other DJs say, "damn".
If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram.
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose.
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice.
If there was a problem, Yo -- I'll solve it!
Check out the hook while Deshay revolves it.
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla.
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla.
Yo man -- Let's get out of here! Word to your mother!
Ice Ice Baby Too cold, Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold.
Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold, Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold.
We're no strangers to love.
You know the rules and so do I.
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of.
You wouldn't get this from any other guy.
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling.
Gotta make you understand.
Never gonna give you up.
Never gonna let you down.
Never gonna run around and desert you.
Never gonna make you cry.
Never gonna say goodbye.
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
We've known each other for so long..
Your heart's been aching, but.
You're too shy to say it.
Inside, we both know what's been going on.
We know the game and we're gonna play it.
And if you ask me how I'm feeling.
Don't tell me you're too blind to see.
Never gonna give you up.
Never gonna let you down.
Never gonna run around and desert you.
Never gonna make you cry.
Never gonna say goodbye.
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
Never gonna give you up.
Never gonna let you down.
Never gonna run around and desert you.
Never gonna make you cry.
Never gonna say goodbye.
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
(Ooh, give you up).
(Ooh, give you up).
Never gonna give, never gonna give.
(Give you up).
Never gonna give, never gonna give.
(Give you up).
We've known each other for so long.
Your heart's been aching, but.
You're too shy to say it.
Inside, we both know what's been going on.
We know the game and we're gonna play it.
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling.
Gotta make you understand.
Never gonna give you up.
Never gonna let you down.
Never gonna run around and desert you.
Never gonna make you cry.
Never gonna say goodbye.
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
Never gonna give you up.
Never gonna let you down.
Never gonna run around and desert you.
Never gonna make you cry.
Never gonna say goodbye.
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
Never gonna give you up.
Never gonna let you down.
Never gonna run around and desert you.
Never gonna make you cry.
Never gonna say goodbye.
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me.
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb.
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead.
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming.
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running.
Didn't make sense not to live for fun.
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb.
So much to do, so much to see.
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go.
You'll never shine if you don't glow.
Hey, now, you're an All Star, get your game on, go play.
Hey, now, you're a Rock Star, get the show on, get paid.
And all that glitters is gold.
Only shooting stars break the mold.
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder.
You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older.
But the meteor men beg to differ.
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture.
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin.
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim.
My world's on fire. How about yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored.
Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas.
I need to get myself away from this place.
I said yep, what a concept.
I could use a little fuel myself.
And we could all use a little change.
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming.
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running.
Didn't make sense not to live for fun.
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb.
So much to do, so much to see.
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go.
You'll never shine if you don't glow.
And all that glitters is gold.
Only shooting stars break the mold.
