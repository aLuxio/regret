Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house, not a creature was stirring not even a mouse, the stockings were hung by the chimney with care in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there. The children were nestled all snug in their beds while visions of sugarplums danced in their heads. And mama and her kerchif, and I in my cap, had just settled our brains for a long winters nap. When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter! I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter! Away to the window I flew like a flash! Tore open the shudders and threw up the sash! The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow gave the luster of reighndeer to objects below. When what to my wandering eyes should appear but a miniature sleigh and 8 tiny reighndeer.
